At the [DSA](https://www.schuelerakademien.de/deutsche-schuelerakademie), I made a promise:

> When the first attendant of one of my programming workshops would be finished with reading the first book for [[Learning to Program]] I proposed, I would start to draft the guide to Software Engineering I would've liked to have when I was younger.

That happened _nine days_ after the DSA finished.

So now I find myself writing this guide (still <Il href="learning-to-c">on here</Il> for now)â€”and I'm really enjoying it so far.
