I've just had my latest hour-long [[Roaming the Web]]-spree. It started off with reading this great article on relationhips ([How Relationships Actually Work](https://integrationbyparts.substack.com/p/how-relationships-actually-work)), and went on with me reading [half](https://integrationbyparts.substack.com/p/conversational-navigation) [of](https://integrationbyparts.substack.com/p/i-feel-like-youre-an-asshole) [her](https://integrationbyparts.substack.com/p/relationship-known-issues) [blog](https://integrationbyparts.substack.com/p/revealing-secrets).

Then I found out [she's together with Eliezer](https://manifold.markets/GrettaDuleba/will-eliezer-and-gretta-still-be-re?play=true), which made me go reading some nice [[LessWrong]] articles.

Specifically those two from [Duncan Sabien](https://homosabiens.substack.com/):

- [Lies, Damn Lies and Fabricated Options](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gNodQGNoPDjztasbh/lies-damn-lies-and-fabricated-options)
- [You don't exist, Duncan](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yepKvM5rsvbpix75G/you-don-t-exist-duncan)

It's probably fair to say I'm in the general vicinity of an [Information Monster](https://kevinmunger.substack.com/p/tyler-cowen-is-an-information-monster).
