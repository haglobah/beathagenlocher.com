Today I finally watched [A Language Server for your DSL for Fun and Profit](https://media.ccc.de/v/bob11-2025-language-server-for-your-dsl-siebenhandl), which was a pretty nice talk.

In the talk, he mentions [L4](https://l4.legalese.com/get-started/your-first-rule)—it's a [[Specification Language]] for legal systems.

Looks interesting!
