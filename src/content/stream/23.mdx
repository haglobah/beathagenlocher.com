Day 2 of the [Zurihac 2025](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2025/), and I'm trying out [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/).

As regularly is the case, since I'm on [[NixOS]], things don't work directly out of the box.

[This guide](https://sebasti.a.nullri.ch/lean4/doc/setup/nix.html) in particular doesn't work anymore since the official [[Nix Flake]] [got deprecated](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4895).

Luckily, there is a [new one](https://github.com/lenianiva/lean4-nix) that just worksâ„¢.

Up to some [[Functional Programming]] with it.
