We're currently thinking about which course to teach at a possible next [Sch√ºlerAkademie](https://www.schuelerakademien.de/deutsche-schuelerakademie) next year.

We thought a course that traverses a sizeable chunk of the abstraction stack of [[Computer Science]] could be pretty nice, and I had a website that did that in mind for starting my investigation into course materials.
However, I didn't do that immediately, and found [_NAND to Tetris_](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) on one of [[Eli Tyre]]'s links first. This somehow felt familiar.
And I'm still not sure where I saw it/read about it first, but just today I sorted some links about [Supernuclear](https://supernuclear.substack.com/) into my personal knowledge base, one of which was a [guest post](https://prigoose.substack.com/p/how-to-start-a-university) by one of the [Fractal University](https://fractaluniversity.substack.com/) (which I already knew) people, which [taught _NAND to Tetris_ before](https://fractaluniversity.substack.com/p/fall-2023-courses?open=false#%C2%A7cs-foundations-of-computing-from-nand-to-tetris).

I love it when I find out a graph is connected like that.
