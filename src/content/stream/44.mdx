Ever got annoyed by having to do a lot of very simple and repetitive actions?

For solving that, being able to control your whole editor programmatically is _pretty neat_.

It's not much, but just now I added a small new capability to my Emacs, which is:

Being able to create those small blog post files from whereever I am.

This is what it looks like:

```elisp
(defun bah/new-streamlet ()
 (interactive)
 (let* ((dg-root "~/beathagenlocher.com")
        (stream-folder (doom-path dg-root "src" "content" "stream"))
        (next-number (->> (directory-files stream-folder nil (rx ".mdx"))
                          (map 'list
                               (lambda (filename)
                                 (string-to-number (file-name-sans-extension filename))))
                          (sort)
                          (reverse)
                          (first)
                          (+ 1)))
        (next-streamlet-filename (concat (number-to-string next-number) ".mdx"))
        (next-streamlet-path (doom-path stream-folder next-streamlet-filename)))
   (with-temp-file next-streamlet-path (insert "stream"))
   (find-file next-streamlet-path)
   (move-end-of-line nil)
   (evil-append 0)))

(map! :leader
      :prefix ("e" . "personal")
      :desc "Writing: Streamlet" :nv "s" #'bah/new-streamlet)
```
