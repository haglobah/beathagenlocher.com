For quite some time I've been a bit jealous of the [[NeoVim]] people for having something like [Typr](https://github.com/nvzone/typr) or [DuckyType](https://github.com/kwakzalver/duckytype.nvim) available to them.

But I've never really translated that into actually searching for a [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) package for [[Emacs]].

Today, I didâ€”and found [emacs-monkeytype](https://github.com/jpablobr/emacs-monkeytype).

This combined with [The touch typing test text editor \| Drew's blogsite](https://drewsh.com/monkeytype-emacs-workflow) makes for a pretty nice workflow :)

(commit that adds it: [haglobah/doom#7bfe9a0](https://github.com/haglobah/doom/commit/7bfe9a048ae202ea6b9a8e0aa6c0e962addfaa2f))
