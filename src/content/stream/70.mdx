Just today I ran into a weird issue:

```shell
The file does not exist at "<project_root>/node_modules/.vite/deps/chunk-3QUCSPQG.js?v=xxxxxxxx" which is in the optimize deps directory. The dependency might be incompatible with the dep optimizer. Try adding it to `optimizeDeps.exclude`
```

Refreshing it via the browser cache solves it:

Makes sense, but could use a better error message before everyone first nukes their `node_modules/` ^^
