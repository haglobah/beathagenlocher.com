Today, I thought about making myself less dependent on Github (once again).

There are a few ways to do that (I still want to have an account on Github and be there, just be less dependent on them) – the easiest thing for this would be setting up a git mirror.

I could do that by setting up my private git forge ([forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) or [gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)), or by just going to one of the git hosters ([Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/))

Two promising tools for that seem to be:

- https://github.com/ChappIO/git-backup
- and https://github.com/cooperspencer/gickup

But _actually_ setting this up is for another day. ^^

(Small caveat: Codeberg [doesn't want you to mirror your stuff there for resource reasons](https://gickup.dev/configuration/destination_docu/gitea).)
