Today I learned about [On the Effectiveness of FIXMEs](https://presumably.de/on-the-effectiveness-of-fixmes.html).

The TL;DR:

Having a kind of code comment that's a immediate todo is helpful. That's because you can use it for lowering your mental workload while writing the code.

Instead of just dropping the part of the modeling you don't want to concern yourself with right now, you place a crumb there to pick it up later.

And that's pretty helpful.
