Lately, I had the impression that my workflows somehow stabilized.

I've been relatively happy with [my window manager](https://www.gnome.org/) combined with [[gnome-magic-window]], and haven't been tweaking my keybinds for applications much lately.

I've been using [[Doom Emacs]] for [quite some time now](https://github.com/haglobah/doom/commit/ca1e9fedf96546949fb708dfcf08b12d0bc9760c) and spend less and less time customizing some behavior of it.

Compared to this, my keyboard layout feels almost completely stable with only minor changes in the whole of 2024, for example.

But lately, I've feel like I've hit a few ceilings at the same time—and now

- I can type `-` and `_` faster
- `vsplits` are more natural in [[Emacs]]
- Moving around [[S-Expression]]s is cleaner
- And for the first time in ages, I now play around with pure, non-[[Home Row Mod]] Shift buttons on my keyboard.

Well, what can I say? I do like being in a state of [[Flow]]—and am definitely willing to pay the price for it.
