After I just properly learned/understood how completion in [[Emacs]] works, today I had my 'wait a moment' moment for knowing what to google to emoji input via `:shortcodes:` in [[Emacs]].

It's as easy as _knowing_ that you need to google "emacs company emoji input"

And then the thing that immediately worked was [company-emoji](https://codeberg.org/egirl/company-emoji).

```elisp
;; packages.el
(package! company-emoji)
```

```elisp
;; config.el
(require 'company-emoji)
(after! markdown-mode
  (set-company-backend! 'markdown-mode 'company-emoji))
```

Nice to be able to easily type emojis again, finally! 🙌
