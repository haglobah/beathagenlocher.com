Over the last few weeks, I've grown more and more uncomfortable with the amount of different tasks I've been keeping in my head right now. I played around with a bunch of todo apps, and none of them has been really satisfactory.

All I want(ed) is a an app with:

- fast UI
- nice search with filtering
- nice search for scheduling
- I can use as my inbox for everything, _also things to read_. It should integrate with the sharing menu of my phone.
- I can use from anywhere I can access the internet
- I can use without Internet
- That never, ever produces any sync weirdness between devices.

Shouldn't be _that_ hard, right?

So far, it sounds like I probably could make [Amazing Marvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/) do what I want.

But I'm definitely _also_ using this as an example application to try out [[local-first software]] frameworks.
