Today I learned that there's a home manager module for generating a [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) config.

You can find it here: https://github.com/uimataso/vimium-nixos

Nothing crazy, but still pretty nice.

This is what my config looks like now

```nix
home.vimiumOptions = {
  enable = true;

  outputFilePath = ".cache/vimium-options.json";

  keyMappings = {
  unmapAll = true;
  map = {
      j = "goBack";
      y = "goForward";
      l = "scrollPageDown";
      u = "scrollPageUp";
      f = "LinkHints.activateMode";
      p = "LinkHints.activateModeToOpenInNewTab";
    };
  };
};
```
