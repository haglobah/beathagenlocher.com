I'm already a person that tends to do this enough/a lot, but today I got inspired to do it some more: [Do One New Thing A Day To Solve Your Problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gtk2KqEtedMi7ehxN/do-one-new-thing-a-day-to-solve-your-problems)

(I think I've got a loose contact on one of the nice!nanos on my keyboard–and today, I finally resolved to just buy a new one – not even really new, but nevertheless ^^)
