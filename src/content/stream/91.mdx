Today I learned [Lix](https://lix.systems/) has an installer that's based off the determinate systems one now.

Nice!

Repo here: https://git.lix.systems/lix-project/lix-installer#the-lix-installer

So now, you can install Lix with this command:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
```
