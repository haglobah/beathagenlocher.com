Over the last few weeks, I found `lsp-mode` TypeScript suggestion to be slower than they should've been.

The full-on solution is [lsp-bridge](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge) (which makes the lsp stuff work asynchronously), but I first wanted to try what `lsp-mode` still has to offer.

There's [emacs-lsp-booster](https://github.com/blahgeek/emacs-lsp-booster), and I'm using it now :)
