Pretty recently, I saw the monthly newsletter by [Globa Development & Economic Advancement](https://gdea.substack.com/) in my inbox.

I couldn't remember that I subscribed to it, and was really pleasantly surprised. Of the pieces that sounded interesting and which I read, 100% were. Some gems:

- [How Asia Works](https://www.tosummarise.com/book-summary-how-asia-works-by-joe-studwell/)
- [(On measuring) GDP: We don't really know how good we have it](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/11/gdp-we-really-don-t-know-how-good-we-have-it)

But take a look at the rest if you're interested: [GDEA Substack \| October 2025](https://gdea.substack.com/p/october-2025)
