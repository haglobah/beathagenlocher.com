I'm always on the lookout for 'the perfect' slides program (whatever that might be).

I like:
- full power of a programming language (runnable code snippets, for example, slides as code)
- good interop with other stuff (web, mostly)
- runnable code in slides
- easy/fast to write slides (lol)

Strong contenders are/have been [Reveal JS](https://revealjs.com), [Slidev][https://sli.dev], [impress.js](https://impress.js.org/) and [Racket Slideshow](https://docs.racket-lang.org/slideshow/).

Today, I found out about [presenterm](https://mfontanini.github.io/presenterm/introduction.html) (slides that run from your terminal)

Looks promising!
