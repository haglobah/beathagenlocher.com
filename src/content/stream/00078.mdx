Today I learned that Emacs has a word and character-counting command baked in:

`M-x count-words`

But following the [StackExchange thread on counting words](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/73757/how-to-count-the-number-of-characters-in-the-marked-selected-region), I discovered

- `M-|`: (`shell-command-on-region`)

That is _pretty_ nice for doing anything fast you know how to do in the shell, but lack the knowledge to do with [[Emacs]] tools right now.
