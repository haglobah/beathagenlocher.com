After getting annoyed by the default sqlite Command Line Interface (it doesn't even support `arrow up` ≙ last typed command), I found [`litecli`](https://github.com/dbcli/litecli)

```nix title=flake.nix
# ...
packages = [
# ...
   pkgs.litecli
# ...
];
# ...
```

in every sqlite project from now on :)
