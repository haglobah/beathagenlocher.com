<Il href="magit">`magit`</Il> is a tool where I regularly think "_I wonder..._", and then it _just works_.

I had that alredy with discovering that—obviously—I can also `commit --amend` from the commit menu, and today I had it with navigating and manipulating the whole commit tree (`l b`).

When in the commit tree view, you can just do whatever you normally did and see the result directly.

Checkout an commit? -> Hover over it, then `b c`
Rebase a branch? Check it out, then `r b`

And so on.  
Sweet!
