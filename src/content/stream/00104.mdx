I've spent the last few days figuring out how to add Auth to a side project I'm building right now, and it's absolutely crazy just how many solutions are out there.

(And they seem pretty straightforward, most of the time).

The thing is that what I'm building relies on [[Automerge]]

(In hindsight, I probably just should've committed to one of the many, many different frameworks and approaches that are out there).

Just for a short listing of what I considered:

- Supertokens
- Logto
- Auth0
- Keycloak
- Supabase

In the end I settled on logto (for now), but I'm not so sure anymore whether that was the right solution.

I wanted it to be:
- independent from my db (since I don't need one except for my root automerge doc id)
- self-hostable

- I thought custom jwt token claims would be nice (not sure they're _that_ important anymore)

(One of the reasons was that I don't have a )
