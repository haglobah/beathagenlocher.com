Lol. Just now I learned that GNOME doesn't give you a way of changing the battery percentage. You somehow got to know that there's another service, UPower, that does this.

So for changing the battery warning percentage, you got to edit `/etc/UPower/UPower.conf`:

```conf
# UPower.conf
[UPower]
AllowRiskyCriticalPowerAction=false
CriticalPowerAction=HybridSleep
EnableWattsUpPro=false
IgnoreLid=false
NoPollBatteries=false
PercentageAction=2
PercentageCritical=5
PercentageLow=20 # set this to 30 or whatever
TimeAction=120
TimeCritical=300
TimeLow=1200
UsePercentageForPolicy=true
```

Or on [[NixOS]]:

```nix
# configuration.nix

{
  config = {
    services.upower.percentageLow = 30;
  };
}

```
