(Mostly just a note to my future self)

Somehow I just had issues with [[Doom Emacs]]'s `map!` function and unmapping the <KB>Return</KB> key in company mode. 

This didn't work: 

```elisp
(map! :map company-active-mode
  "RET" nil
  "TAB" #'company-complete-selection)
```

but this did:

```elisp
(after! company
  (keymap-unset company-active-map "<return>" t)
  (define-key company-active-map (kbd "<tab>") #'company-complete-selection))
```

Maybe I'm gonna investigate this later.
