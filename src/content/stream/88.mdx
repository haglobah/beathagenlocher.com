In [[magit]]'s diff view ([[evil mode]]), it happens semi-regularly to me that I want to extract some code out of there to apply to my current state.

There's the option to apply a full hunk `a`

But sometimes, I just want to select a piece of text from there. For that, I could view the buffer at the current state by clicking <KB>Enter</KB> on the hunk, and then selecting it from the normal buffer, but even that gets annoying fast.

Today I realized that I can just set a mark with <KB>C-SPC</KB>, and then select the text normally.

Nice!
