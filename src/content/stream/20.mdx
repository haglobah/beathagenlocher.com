Aaand I've just had my first day at local-first conf!

_What a great crowd_.

My day started with talks [about](https://playb.it/) [some](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/) [pretty](https://github.com/livestorejs) [nice](https://mattweidner.com/2025/05/21/text-without-crdts.html) [topics](https://jazz.tools/), followed by a lunch with an absolutely amazing range of topics.

We went from [[Clojure]] to [[Emacs]] to _Semantic Zooming_ to [[Simon Willison]] to [`llm`](https://github.com/simonw/llm) to [[Bret Victor]] and [[Dynamicland]] (and a new talk of him [being online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PixPSNRDNMU)!), to [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [personal setup](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/), all interleaved with local-first stuff.

And that was only until just after lunch.
