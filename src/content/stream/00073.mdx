Oh wow:

I've apparently never properly thought about the word _lingua franca_ in its parts.  
It literally means "language of the francs", which makes total sense.

That makes it harder for me now to point to the general principle behind it—german has it better there:

It's not only the word lingua franca we can and need to use—there's also another one:
_Verkehrssprache_ (meaning "language you commonly use when interacting")
