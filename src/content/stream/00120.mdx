Today, I thought about writing and publishing an extension to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/).

I researched, and found this funny bit:

The EU apparently requires you to indicate whether you're a _Trader_ or _Non-Trader_, when you want to publish extensions on the store.

Which is fine, (I guess), but apparently literally no one has a definitive answer to what that means:
