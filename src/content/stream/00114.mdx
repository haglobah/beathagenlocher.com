Today, I lurked a bit around the on the [clan gitea](https://git.clan.lol/clan/clan-core/), which made me find [this nice PR](https://git.clan.lol/clan/clan-core/issues/6655) trying to nail down a better clan positioning in the future, which made me find [selfhostblocks](https://github.com/ibizaman/selfhostblocks).

Cool!

(Though I'm pretty convinced by clan so far)
