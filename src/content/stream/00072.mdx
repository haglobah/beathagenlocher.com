Today, I let haiku critique and write out bare drafts from my side into proper texts, and I think it worked pretty well.

That is an interesting property about LLMs:
I think that human-interaction-wise, the style in which they generate text could become a new lingua franca-like thing but for writing style. (-> [[Writing with LLMs is Googling in Reverse]])
