I've already thought for a few times about setting up an LDAP service for organizations I'm in, and always stoppen doing it/thinking about it, because it didn't seem worth the effort.

Now (thanks to being on the [clan.lol Matrix Server](https://matrix.to/#/#clan:clan.lol)) I learned about [Kanidm](https://kanidm.com/), which sounds way easier to use.

But especially valuable is Kanidms' [Comparisons page](https://kanidm.com/comparisons/) where there's several other options listed.

I probably just should've looked for a bit longer when I researched the LDAP stuff last time :)
