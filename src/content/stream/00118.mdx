Just now I learned

- about [Shannon](https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon), an pentesting agent
- and that there's still an ongoint "Emacs in Rust" experiment people are actively working on!
  -> [rune](https://github.com/CeleritasCelery/rune)

Looking forward to try Shannon out ^^

(rune isn't anything more than an Elisp interpreter right now)
