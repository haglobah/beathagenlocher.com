I'm always having a hard time when people use a mathy notation in a context where it _could_ make sense, but doesn't _really_.

This is one of them: [Big L Notation](https://www.swyx.io/big-l-notation)

I don't event know what assigning 'learnings' with a big-O like complexity _should mean_.

And this irritates me, which is pretty sadâ€”because I mostly think articles like these have a point, and have a good one at that.

And that's the case here, too :)
