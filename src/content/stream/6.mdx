I just corrected my `<CodeBlock />` component and it inexplicably blew out of its enclosing element.

Nothing ordinary helped until I found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/1do1ere/comment/laal2aj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

[[CSS]] is, indeed, quite weird sometimes.

(The problem is that `grid`s try to accomodate to the size of their elements. The solution is to apply `min-w-0` to all of the elements.)
