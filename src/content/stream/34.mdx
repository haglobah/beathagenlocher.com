Lol. Today I learned that you can reference commits in git by searching through their messages:

In this commit graph:

```shell
* 30997b5 (HEAD -> main, bugFix) Add lala
* ceeae15 Add hehe
* c4a2cd2 Add hoho
* b2627b3 Add a
```

```shell
git show :/hoho
```

does the thing you'd expectâ€”it shows commit `c4a2cd2`. Nice!
