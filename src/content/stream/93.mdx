Yesterday was [Tü.λ](https://tu-lambda.github.io) again and the topic of the day was [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) (and with it, reproducible package management).

There's also an [[Operating System]] based on Guix, _Guix System_ (as there is with [[Nix]] and [[NixOS]]) with basically the same trade-offs.

One of these trade-offs is that due to the nature of reproducible packages, you can't just run any linux binary directly on your system (cause they normally rely on dynamically linked libraries).

(There are some pretty easy workarounds to that, though)

That's why it's doubly important and useful to have as many packages packaged in Guix's and Nix's package repos [Guix Packages](https://packages.guix.gnu.org) and [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages)

After coming to that point at Tü.λ, I showed people the package repo [size/freshness graph from repology](https://repology.org/repositories/graphs), and could rest assured that basically everything you'll need that's available on Linux is also in nixpkgs.
