I just tried out [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check) for property testing in TypeScript, and my first impression is it's pretty sweet.

With most of the things in JS, it's half pretty straightforward and half quite some steps you need to take if you're setting it up from scratch.

```shell
# -1. Have vite
# 0. Install a test runner
npm install --save-dev vitest
# 1. Install fast-check
npm install --save-dev fast-check
```

And then, for:

```ts
// modulo.ts
export const mod = (n: number, m: number): number => {
  return ((n % m) + m) % m
}
```

add this

```ts
# modulo.test.ts
import fc from 'fast-check'
import { describe, it } from 'vitest'

describe('mod', () => {
  it('result is always in range [0, m)', () => {
    fc.assert(
      fc.property(fc.integer(), fc.integer({ min: 1 }), (n, m) => {
        const result = mod(n, m)
        return result >= 0 && result < m
      })
    )
  })
})
```
