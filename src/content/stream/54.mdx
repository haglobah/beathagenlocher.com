Some setup:

I regularly think about why our civilization currently struggles the way it does, and I think a significant part of our struggles comes from not really having an alternative system available to which we can compare ourselves to.

It feels like—viewed from an average western citizen—having competing socialist countries with high equality available for comparison gave governing bodies _a really good_ incentive to not let e.g. inequality  go out of hand.

This easily-comparable-alternative died in 1990, and since then, we have a [hard time to even imagine an alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_Realism).

So, even if it were just for the quality of our collective imagination—it would be pretty nice to have a different and competing society to ours available to compare ourselves to.

And optimally, it wouldn't even only be _one_, but a diverse set of them: Something up to Scott Alexander's Archipelago of communities from [Archipelago and Atomic Communitarianism](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/).

And _this_ is why it both makes me pretty happy to see that people are finally experimenting with this, and quite a bit sad that basically all of them sound like the same US-libertarian-web3-AI wet dream.

Well, I wish them all the best :)
