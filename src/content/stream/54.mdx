I regularly think about why our civilization currently struggles the way it does, and I think a significant part of our struggles comes from not really having an alternative system available to which we can compare ourselves to.

It feels like—viewed the normal population of the west—having competing socialist countries with high equality available gave governing bodies _a really good_ incentive to not let inequality, for example, go out of hand.

But since 1990, there hasn't really been an alternative anymore, and what's worse, we have a [hard time even imagining one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_Realism).

A natural resolution to this missing incentive would be to have something that can be viewed as a competing society by normal-ish people.

Optimally, it wouldn't even be only _one_, but rather something akin to Scott Alexander's Archipelago of communities from [Archipelago and Atomic Communitarianism](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/).

And _this_ is why it both makes me pretty happy to see that people are finally experimenting with this, and quite a bit sad that basically all of them sound like the same US-libertarian-web3-AI wet dream.

Well, I wish them all the best :)
