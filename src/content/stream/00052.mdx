I'm always having a hard time when people use a mathy notation in a context where it _could_ make sense, but doesn't _really_.

This is one of them: [Big L Notation](https://www.swyx.io/big-l-notation)

I don't event know what assigning 'learnings' with a big-O like complexity _should mean_.

And this _irritates_ me, which is pretty sad.
Because normally articles like these have a point—they just fail to formulate the point in _Maths_.

This article is like that: It has a point, but fails to formulate it in Maths :)
