I'm currently reading The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephensonâ€”and just now one of the protagonists came upon something called _Needle's eye_ in an ancient city. It's a small stone arch that's used to keep camels out of spaces.

Suddenly the bible quote with the camel and the needles eye makes _a lot_ more sense.

And this is not the first time Stephenson weaves a nice little fact into the overall story (though I can't remember the other occurences right now).  
Pretty nice!
