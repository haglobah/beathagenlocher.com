Over the last few weeks, I've spent some time on and off researching a good way to do Authn and Authz, and struggled quite a bit with the number of options available.

Not completely understanding what I'm doing/how to search for my requirements, I've first started trying Logto (but that an UI clicking contest to set up), then going for [[kanidm]] without realizing this doesn't have support for a public sign in form, which is something I need.

And just now when I'm relatively sure that [[Better Auth]] fits my needs quite well, I've discovered [[Stack Auth]] via this nice website: https://www.auth0alternatives.com/

Man, if I only would've found this 4 weeks earlier.
