TIL about [[Elysia]], a .. pretty nice-looking new-ish framework for writing strongly typed web services that has a strong emphasis on [[Bun]].

[Their docs](https://elysiajs.com/at-glance.html) are pretty nice, they have cool [tutorial/playground](https://elysiajs.com/tutorial/) (and a very small thing: Their [CORS plugin](https://elysiajs.com/plugins/cors.html) just works (that's not _that_ high of a bar, I know))

I especially like how code example-heavy their comparison pages are: https://elysiajs.com/migrate/from-hono.html

Sweet!
