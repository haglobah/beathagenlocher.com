I swear it's not been _that_ long when I last looked at the news page of [[Spritely Institute]] (okay, it's been about [one and a half years](https://www.spritely.institute/news/cirkoban-sokoban-meets-cellular-automata-written-in-scheme.html)), but _man_ did they work on stuff.

They've started work on their [[Malleable Software]]/sandboxing foreign code equivalent, [Oaken](https://www.spritely.institute/news/announcing-spritely-oaken.html), created a prototype [composing OCaps and CRDTs](https://www.spritely.institute/news/composing-capability-security-and-conflict-free-replicated-data-types.html) and that was already enough to go through.

Pretty exciting stuff!
