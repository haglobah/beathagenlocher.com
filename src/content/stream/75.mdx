Apparently you can't open links from `iframe`s in new tabs or windows.

Sad.

But searching for the question on StackOverflow brings you back to the olden days of the site at which at least one of the answers was [completely](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14856259/how-to-open-a-new-tab-from-iframe) [ignoring](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4583792/make-links-inside-an-iframe-open-in-a-new-window) the point of the question.
