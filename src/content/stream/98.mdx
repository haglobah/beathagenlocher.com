Lol, I learned two new words: [Finitary and Infinitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary)

They mean the simplest thing you would expect: That something has a <span class="font-bold">finit</span>e <span class="font-bold">ar</span>it<span class="font-bold">y</span> or an <span class="font-bold">infinit</span>e <span class="font-bold">ar</span>it<span class="font-bold">y</span>.

Apparently these words get said more often than I'd have expected ^^
