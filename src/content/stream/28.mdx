Just got recommended [Eli Tyre](https://elityre.com/)—and he's got a nice write-up of types of [Capital](https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2025/07/14/reflections-three-categories-of-capital/) (I already thought in those three types of Capital before, though—probably not the most novel idea on earth ^^)

But then, I went on a [[roaming the web]] research spree encompassing
- [his dating profile](https://elityre.com/date.html)
  - [how he spends his time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyXcXT8yKdkxSxdkc1G4709NFBtfC6WVZym5rdbcS_s/edit?tab=t.0)
    - [an incredibly cool project/course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
    - [and a pretty nice list of mental models](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xIgHMxmuMjk45FQk_C-pcODLP73eVnms8-zLNnHrvEM/edit?tab=t.0)
- [his bounties](https://elityre.com/bounties.html)
- and [his principles](https://elityre.com/principles.html).

And then branched off to [his books](https://elityre.com/books.html), [Project Lawful](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SA9hDewwsYgnuscae/projectlawful-com-eliezer-s-latest-story-past-1m-words), and to finally downloading the [Functional Decision Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/functional-decision-theory) papers ([1](https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/), [2](https://intelligence.org/2017/03/18/new-paper-cheating-death-in-damascus/))

Ah, I love [[roaming the web]].
