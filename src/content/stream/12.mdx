When first encountering this whole [[Writing Online]] idea, I really didn't consider myself a writer in any capacity.

I even thought something among the lines of "Wow, that would be crazy"/"Wow, that would be so not you."

Well, turns out when I thought that I forgot I had already been writing courses for the [Hacker School](https://hacker-school.de) and walkthroughs/guides for [42 School](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/) for quite some time already. 

Brains are interesting.
