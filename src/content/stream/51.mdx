I'm currently looking at a solution for the Internet issues when travelling via DB, and found this lovely Wikipedia page:

[IPv4 Address Blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assigned_/8_IPv4_address_blocks)

I've always wondered whom the local `10.0.0.0/8` range originally belonged to. Go and see for yourself :)
