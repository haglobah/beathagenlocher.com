Last night, I finished reading [Augment Human Intellect](dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned-original/1962-augment-3906-Augmenting-Human-Intellect-a-Conceptual-Framework.pdf), a summary report on Computer Use for [[Tools for Thought]] (also incredibly old: it's from 1962) written by Douglas Engelbart, the guy behind the [The Mother of All Demos](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos)

Content-wise, it's pretty good: We've got some way towards it, but we're still miles away from achieving the human augmentation he describes in the report.

Regarding the Wrting Style, I'm honestly surprised just how badly its written.  
Every other sentence is a jumble of the words _process_, _function_, _structure_, _substructure_, and basically every verb is substantivized.
