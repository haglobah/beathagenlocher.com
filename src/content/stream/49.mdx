At some time in 2019, I started journaling about to get a clearer head about thoughts and other open threads I accumulated during the day.

Through it, I've come to appreciate [[Leslie Lamports]] [_If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking_](https://conversational-leadership.net/quotation/thinking-writing/), and I still do think it's pretty great.

Writing about things that feel fuzzy in my head really clears the fog, and the things get concrete.

But I've always struggled with transferring that clarity to bigger thoughts, that is, thoughts rummaging in myself for a longer period of time.

And sometimes during last year, I've started with something new trying to tackle this:

- Every week (or so, lol), I'm writing a [[Weekly Review]]
- And every 12-week cycle, I'm doing a [[Microlife Review]] and outlook spanning the last and next 12 weeks

I found that this works nicely for the bigger stuff in life.
