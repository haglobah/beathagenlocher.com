Lol. I spent 20 minutes researching/reading Github issues on how to correctly setting up aider with playwright on [[NixOS]], only to realize then that someone's already done it the way it should've been done:

In addition to the `aider-chat` package in `nixpkgs`, there's an `aider-chat-with-playwright` package that does the right thing.

Sweet :)
