I just found out about [Extism](https://github.com/extism/extism), a framework that lets you write plugins in {`Rust`, `JS`, `Python`, `Go`, `Haskell`, `.NET`, `C`, `C++`, `Zig`} as of now, compiles them to WASM, and then lets you call the resulting WASM modules from even more programming languages, but with only limited capabilities.

This looks like one of the frameworks finally fulfilling one of the promises of WASM (namely the one replacing docker, see [Rust, WebAssembly and the future of Serverless](www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB6AlE1QuI)).

Interesting!
