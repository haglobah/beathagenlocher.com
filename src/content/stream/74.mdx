I came up with a new and simple think I really like (utilizing <Il href="just">`just`</Il>):

```just
# Justfile

open cmd="":
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    url="http://localhost:8080"

    if [[ -n "{{ cmd }}" ]]; then
        {{ cmd }} "$url"
    elif command -v xdg-open &> /dev/null; then
        xdg-open "$url"
    elif command -v open &> /dev/null; then
        open "$url"
    else
        echo "No suitable cmd found. Please install xdg-open or open."
        exit 1
    fi
```

This adds a canocical command for "opening" your projects.

My preferred way of launching a project is now:

```shell
just open chromium && just dev
```

(which becomes <Ol href="https://github.com/haglobah/nix-home/blob/4526d514198fb88e9fdd050c5540ac1788935804/programs/fish.nix#L83">`jod`</Ol>)
