I just came home from my first day of [Local-first Conference](https://www.localfirstconf.com/)‚Äîthe less official [[Unconference]] part, and I had a pretty great day.

I've worked a bit more with [[jazz.tools]], and had so many interesting conversations.

Today, I:
- read [Project Cambria](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/)
- thought a lot about bidirectional lenses
- learned where the _Software as Aircraft Carriers, not Bicycles_ quote [is coming from](https://2020.programming-conference.org/home/salon-2020)
- got reminded of [Darklang](https://darklang.com/)
- learned more properly about [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh)
- and got reminded of how weird/hard [[Schema Migration]] and [[Identity]] actually are.

10/10.
Can recommend.
