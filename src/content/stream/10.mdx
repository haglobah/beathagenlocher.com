One of the pretty nice things about writing my own [[Digital Garden]] is how much I'm able to just implement everything I would've liked to have on other websites.

I've just implemented something I really would've liked to have on other websites:

A reading progress bar that indicates both the progress and the total reading time of the note _by highlighting the part of the bar that you can currently see_.  
It's a relatively minor thing, I knowâ€”but what can I say: I really like those small and simple solutions.
