Currently, finally getting my feet wet with [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/).

And I must say, I really do like what I see so far.
The website is clear about what you get, the Docs look nice, and it's got good and readable error messages.

But what on earth is this?

```ocaml
@react.component
let make = () => {
  let (count, setCount) = React.useState(() => 0)

  <div className="p-6">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold"> {"What is this about?" -> React.string} </h1>
    <p>
      {React.string("This is a simple template for a Vite project using ReScript & Tailwind CSS.")}
    </p>
    <Button onClick={_ => setCount(count => count + 1)}>
      {React.string(`count is ${count->Int.toString}`)}
    </Button>
  </div>
}
```

Yep, you see that right. One has to explicitly cast every `string` to a `React.string`.

(Sounds like it's due to it not having the ability to form [[Union Types]] with [[Base Types]]. Hmm.)
