I've just finished reading [The Hydrogen Sonata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hydrogen_Sonata), the now sixth (? I think) [[Culture]] book I've read.  
Pretty nice book, although I would sort it into the middle of all the culture books I've read so far.
(Doesn't surpass [[Player of Games]] or [[Consider Phloebas]], for example)

And I think I'm at the point where I find the [[Culture]] books all a bit too similarâ€”but hey, what can you do when you still very much enjoy reading them.
