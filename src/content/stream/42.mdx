A few days ago, I read [Explaining British Naval Dominance During the Age of Sail](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YE4XsvSFJiZkWFtFE/explaining-british-naval-dominance-during-the-age-of-sail) have been thinking about it quite regularly since.

You should go and read it—it's not that long—but the TL;DR is that when you have bad and/or long feedback loops, having good incentive systems in place makes you win wars.
