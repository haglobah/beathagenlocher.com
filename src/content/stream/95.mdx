I just came upon this pretty interesting post by Jeremy Gibbons:  
[How to design Co-Programs](https://patternsinfp.wordpress.com/2018/11/21/how-to-design-co-programs/)

His point is that _data structure determines program structure_ (or at least should), and there's an easy way to apply this principle (data structure => program structure) that's missing from _How to Design Programs_:

htdp mostly concerns itself with deriving programs from the **input** data, but doesn't talk about deriving programs from what the **output** data. (If that sentence doesn't produce a clear picture in your head, go now and read his article)

And that's something that hasn't been clear to me until now.
