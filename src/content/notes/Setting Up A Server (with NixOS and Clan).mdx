# 1. Getting the server

As with most things, setting up a server is relatively straighforward once you know what you're doing.

So, what you want is:

- a machine that runs on the internet for you, awaiting your requests and which
- you can reach from anywhere.

Since both the 'is reachable' and the 'runs constantly' parts are relatively hard to provide when you're just starting out (and probably only have a laptop/phone), you want to go to someone who's _job_ is to provide these two things for this (That's called a _Hosting Provider_).

For starting out, the thing you're looking for is the cheapest option of a _Virtual Private Server_ (called VPS).

So for finding what you're looking for, google something like `hosting provider vps cheap reddit`, and see what's currently in store.

(This should be about 5€/month)

Then go onto the site of your choice, create an account, and rent the VPS you want.

For Hetzner in 02/2026 (the provider I'm currently using), this is something like:

- [x] Cost-optimized
- [x] CX23
- [x] Somewhere in the EU, preferably close to where you are
- [x] Ubuntu (but we're gonna change that later)
- [x] both a IPv4 and IPv6
- [ ] your _ssh keys_ (You might be wondering: What are _those_?)
- [x] and a name

That's it.

> Except for the ssh keys.

## Generating ssh keys

An _ssh key_ is a thing you can use to verify you're you to someone else.

For now, the only thing that's important about them is that our server can let us login without a password if we have the correct ssh key available on our system.

So what we need to do is generating a key pair (a private key with a matching public 'lock', confusingly also called a key), and then depositing the _public_ key  of the pair (so the _lock_) on the server.  
With this, the server will be able to tell that we're allowed to login whenever we log in from a system that has the private key of this specific key pair.

With this knowledge:

And then upload the public key to the hetzner.

You can check that everything worked by `ssh`ing onto your server:

If you're _not_ prompted for a password, everything worked.

# 2. Put NixOS on the server with Clan

Now for the important part. Just having a server means manual, stateful configuration, and we're not going to do that.

Instead, we're going to use NixOS with Clan.

Follow [Creating your first Clan](https://docs.clan.lol/main/getting-started/creating-your-first-clan/).

And that's it.
