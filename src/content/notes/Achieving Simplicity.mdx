One of my two overarching problem tackling strategies:

1. Making things simpler
2. Progressing through them faster

<Draft>

- As you can see, simplicity is a big theme on this site
- so many things I work on have my mental workload as the limit.
- making them more simple makes that lower.
- So basically half of what I do is to try and make my life simpler so that I can achieve more by doing less, but more things while making fewer choices
