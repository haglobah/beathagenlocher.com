Hey :)

So you thought about contacting me.  

And since you've come here, the chance I want to hear what you have to say is pretty high.  

The only thing that's missing is you somehow conveying it to me.

It regularly takes me ages to compose good first-contact messages.
So let's try something out: When you want to contact me, I expect you to not waste your time.

Got it?

Read it again: Don't waste _your_ time.

Take the least amount of time possible to convey the stuff you want to sayâ€”or ask me about.

- If you think you can do that via text, do so:  
  [bah@posteo.de](mailto:bah@posteo.de)
- If you think you can do that via a call, book one:  
  [Beat Hagenlocher's cal.com page](https://cal.com/beat-hagenlocher-ekzuqc)

## Wait, that doesn't help at all. What. should. I. write?

Fine. Here are your examples:

### Want to tell me I've got a typo somewhere/sentence jumbled/my english sucks?

```email
To: bah@posteo.de
Subject: Typo
From: You
---

Hey, nice digital garden!

You got a typo here: <`grep`able typo-phrase/whole sentence>
```

### Want to tell me I'm wrong?

```email
To: bah@posteo.de
Subject: You're Wrong on <thing>
From: <You>

Cheers,
