Hey :)

So you thought about contacting me.  

And since you've come here, the chance I want to hear what you have to say is **pretty high**.  

The only thing that's missing is you somehow conveying it to me.

It regularly takes me ages to compose good first-contact messages.
So let's try something out: When you want to contact me, I expect you to **not waste your time**.

Got it?

Read it again: **Don't waste your time**.

Take the least amount of time possible to convey the stuff you want to say—or ask me about.

- If you think you can do that via text, do so:  
  [bah@posteo.de](mailto:bah@posteo.de)
- If you think you can do that via a call, book one:  
  [Beat Hagenlocher's cal.com page](https://cal.com/beat-hagenlocher-ekzuqc)

## Wait, that doesn't help at all. What. should. I. write?

Fine. Here are your examples:

### Want to tell me I've got a typo somewhere/sentence jumbled/my english sucks?

```email
To: bah@posteo.de
Subject: Typo
From: You
---

Hey, nice digital garden!

You got a typo here: <`grep`able typo-phrase/whole sentence>
```

### Want to tell me I'm wrong?

```email
To: bah@posteo.de
Subject: You're Wrong on <thing>
From: <You>
---

Hey, nice digital garden!

(In <content-piece>, )I think you're wrong about <thing>.

(or:
  This article here sums it up nicely:  <article>

  This is why: <reason>
  (For properly understanding it, you should read this: <book/article/whatever>))

Cheers,
<You>
```

### Want to tell me something that might interest me?

```email
To: bah@posteo.de
Subject: Recommendation: <thing>
From: You
---

Hey, I thought you might enjoy this: <link-to-thing>

Cheers,
<You>
```
