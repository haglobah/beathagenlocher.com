Would you like to learn to C?

Let's go.

# -1. This is not your normal guide

This guide is weird.

It's written to get a smart and persevering person started with the nitty-gritty side of programming that doesn't get discussed as often.

Its goal is to supply _a lot_ of information, tasks, and real-world projects while using real-world tools.
For example, this means that this guide will introduce `git` when I think the time has come (which is when you would encounter it in real life). `git`, therefore, will probably be introduced while doing a project.

For this, this guide will alternate between:
- Giving a high-level overview (where we're coming from, where we're going)
- And then diving into guides/projects
- Utilizing whatever good guide/task sheet/project description there already is.
- And supplying the things I found missing when I first learned all of this.

When following this guide, things should become harder and harder, but you shouldn't ever be clueless.
If that happens, it's not your fault, it's mine.
I just made a wild guess on how hard something would be which turned out to be wrong.
If that happens to you, it probably will happen to other people reading this, too.
When something irritates you, please [tell me about it](mailto:bah@posteo.de) so that I can correct it.
(Or, as soon as you're that advanced: Just open a pull request on GitHub ^^)

Remember, this guide assumes you're smart—behave like a smart person:
- Whenever you encounter a problem and have thought about it for a few minutes, _you google it_. (Good sites include StackOverflow)
- When you don't know how something works in general, try to read its documentation (online or via _man pages_—we'll get to that)
- When you really get stuck, _ask for help_. Ask people you know that might know the answer, or [just ask me directly](mailto:bah@posteo.de). When asking questions there's a few things to keep in mind: [1](https://dontasktoask.com/), [2](https://xyproblem.info/), and every site's got its own FAQ on asking ([StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), for example)

Oh, and just to do some expectation management up front: _Don't be fooled by how short this guide appears to be._
Expect that it will will be enough material for _months_.

# 0. Setup

## A. Unix

Get your hands on a [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) system.

This means either:
- [Installing WSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTf32sX9ci0) (docs here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
- Being on macOS—already done.
- Being on Linux—already done, too. :)

## B. Terminal

Open up a [Terminal Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator).

It should show something like this:

```shell
username@system:~ $
```

Verify everything works by typing your first shell command:

```shell
username@system:~ $ ls
```

This should _list_ the contents of your _home directory_—you should recognize some folder names.

And with that, we're ready for Part 1: Navigating the command line

# 1. Navigating the command line

Well, for navigating the command line, there's a pretty good guide available.

The way this is going to work is the following:

The next guide has chapters, and after enough content has been handled, I'll ask you spaced repetition questions to increase your learning.

1. Work through _1. Introducing the Shell_ and _2. Navigating Files and Directories_ of [The Unix Shell | Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

Done?

Time for a review:

<OrbitArea>
  <OrbitPrompt question="How do you find out your current working directory?" answer="`pwd`"/>
  <OrbitPrompt question="How do you show the contents of the current directory?" answer="`ls`"/>
  <OrbitPrompt question="How do you show the contents of the directory `/home/beat/`?" answer="`ls /home/beat/`"/>
  <OrbitPrompt question="How do you show the contents of the `lala` inside your current folder?" answer="`ls ./lala`"/>
  <OrbitPrompt question="How do you show the contents of the directory one level above the one you're currently in?" answer="`ls ..`"/>
  <OrbitPrompt question="Show all hidden files and folders." answer="`ls -a`"/>

Aand: Done!

But now, to really test your knowledge:  
> Complete the [Twelve days of shell](https://12days.cmdchallenge.com/), and, if you're feeling adventurous, as much of the [cmdchallenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/) as you can (or want to) do.

And then, on to other things.

# Intermezzo: Installing stuff

So far, everything you needed to use came preinstalled with your Operating System.

This is about to change.

At the end of this intermezzo, we'd like to have the program `gcc` (one of the C compilers) "installed".
At least that's the term you probably know from Graphical User Interface (GUI) programs.

For our intents and purposes here, _installing a program_ means "making it available for execution". So, installing a program yields this difference:

Uninstalled:

```shell
$ hello
Command not found: "hello"
```

And installed:

```shell
$ hello
Hello, World
```

The normal way to do this would be to install the package via your OS package manager (most probably `apt`), but we won't do that here.  
To exclude a <Il href="works-on-my-machine">whole class of problems</Il> from happening whatsoever, we will install things via [[Nix]].

So, let's get back to your terminal window, and install [[Nix]]:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

After completing the installation process, you should be able to run

```shell
nix --help
```

and see the help.

With that out of the way, back to our original problem: Installing `gcc`.

- Create a new folder in `~`: `learning-to-c`
- Create a new file in that folder: `flake.nix`
- Start editing that file (you now know how). It should end up with the following content:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs?ref=nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs =
    inputs@{
      flake-parts,
      self,
      ...
    }:
    flake-parts.lib.mkFlake { inherit inputs; } {
      systems = [
        "x86_64-linux"
        "aarch64-linux"
        "aarch64-darwin"
        "x86_64-darwin"
      ];
      perSystem =
        {
          config,
          self',
          inputs',
          pkgs,
          system,
          ...
        }:
        {
          _module.args.pkgs = import self.inputs.nixpkgs {
            inherit system;
            config.allowUnfree = true;
          };

          devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
            packages = [
              # interesting part is here.
            ];
          };
        };
    };
}
```

Now, add the package `hello` to the package list:

```nix
packages = [
  pkgs.hello
]
```

Test whether `hello` exists:

```shell
$ which hello
which: no hello in (...)
```

But it doesn't.

For that to happen, we need to enter the so-called _Nix Development Shell_ we just defined in our `flake.nix`:

```shell
nix develop
```

This puts you in a new shell that has `hello` available:

```shell
$ which hello
/nix/store/...-hello-2.12.2/bin/hello
# Verify that it works:
$ hello
Hello, World!
```

Okay, nice.  
And now, let's finally install `gcc`.

```nix
packages = [
  pkgs.hello
  pkgs.gcc15
]
```

Another `nix develop` and it should be there:

```shell
$ which gcc
/nix/store/...-hello-2.12.2/bin/hello
```

And we've installed gcc!
