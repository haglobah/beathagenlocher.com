Would you like to learn to C?

Let's go.

# -1. This is not your normal guide

This guide is weird.

It's written to get a smart and persevering person started with nitty-gritty side of programming that doesn't get discussed as often.

It's goal is to supply _a lot_ of information, tasks, and real-world projects.

For this, it will utilize whatever good guide/task sheet/project description there already is.

When following this guide, things should become harder and harder, but you shouldn't ever be clueless.
If that happens, it's not your fault, it's mine.
I just made a wild guess on how hard something would be which turned out to be wrong.
If that happens to you, it probably will happen to other people reading this, too. Please let me fix it: [Tell me about it](mailto:bah@posteo.de) so that I can correct it. (Or, as soon as you're that advanced: Just open a pull request on GitHub ^^)

Remember, this guide assumes you're smart—behave like a smart person:
- Whenever you encounter a problem and have thought about it for a few minutes, _you google it_. (Good sites include StackOverflow)
- When you don't know how something works in general, try to read its documentation (online or via _man pages_—we'll get to that)
- When you really get stuck, _ask for help_. Ask people you know that might know the answer, or [just ask me directly](mailto:bah@posteo.de). When asking questions there's a few things to keep in mind: [1](https://dontasktoask.com/), [2](https://xyproblem.info/), and every site's got its own FAQ on asking ([StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), for example)

Oh, and just to do some expectation management up front: _Don't be fooled by how short this guide appears to be._ This will be enough material for months.

# 0. Setup

## A. Unix

Get your hands on a [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) system.

This means either:
- [Installing WSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTf32sX9ci0) (docs here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
- Being on macOS—already done.
- Being on Linux—already done, too. :)

## B. Terminal

Open up a [Terminal Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator).

It should show something like this:

```shell
username@system:~ $ 
```

Verify everything works by typing your first shell command:

```shell
username@system:~ $ ls
```

This should _list_ the contents of your _home directory_—you should recognize some folder names.

And with that, we're ready for Part 1: Navigating the command line

# 1. Navigating the command line

Well, there's a pretty good guide available.

1. Work through all of [The Unix Shell | Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

{/*  Review via [Orbit](https://docs.withorbit.com/] */}

2. Test your knowledge: Complete the [Twelve days of shell](https://12days.cmdchallenge.com/), and, if you're feeling adventurous, as much of the [cmdchallenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/) as you can (or want to) do.

# Intermezzo: Installing stuff

So far, everything you needed to use came preinstalled with your Operating System.

This is about to change.

To exclude a <Il href="works-on-my-machine">whole class of problems</Il> from happening whatsoever, we will install things via [[Nix]].

So, let's get back to your terminal window, and install [[Nix]]:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

- Create a new folder in `~`: `learning-to-c`
- Create a new file in that folder: `flake.nix`
- Start editing that file. It should end up with the following content:
