Over the years, I've come to have a keyboard setup I pretty much enjoy.

It's:
- a mechanical split keyboard
- with a small form factor
- with (very light!) Kailh Choc switches
- with a Miryoku-inspired layout
- running ZMK firmware
- using combos all the way down & 5 layers in addition to the base layer
- I use while standing upright with it being tagged to my trousers
