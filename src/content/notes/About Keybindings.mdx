There's a few ways to indicate keybindings. The following are all equivalent:

- "Hold the `control` key, then press `x`, then release, then release `control`, then hold `shift`, press `S`, release `shift`"
- `Control-X Shift-S`
- `Control+X Shift+S`
- `Ctrl-X Shft-X`
- `Ctrl+X Shft-X`
- `^X`
- `C-x S`
- `C-x`
