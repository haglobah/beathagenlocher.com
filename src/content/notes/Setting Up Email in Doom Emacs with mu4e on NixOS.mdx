On some days I feel like I've dug my own grave.

My day started out in a pretty innocent way. I'm currently reading [[The Great CEO Within]], and came across a section on [[Getting Things Done]] especially tailored towards [[Email]].  
Since having an [[Email Client]] + workflow I can halfway be productive with has been something I've had on top of my chore list, I gave it another try—and immediately remembered why I've stopped the last few times:

- [[Email]] itself is tech-wise insanely complex and hard to work with
- it comes from a very different world. In this world it has [inherent and fatal flaws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrGfahzt-4Q)
- Every non-technical [[Email]] tool has some magic baked in that makes it magically go away (and you not aware of it—that's the problem)
{/* - at the same time, every startup that tried to provide a good solution to this as soon as you do have a tool that provides a great workflow, it's lucrative to just focus on business customers, since it's a */}

That taken together makes it a pretty daunting task.

But this time, it didn't stop me.  

## Understanding Email

To work with [[Email]], you need three things:

1. A program to sync your email from a server to a local folder
2. A program to read/view/search your email from that folder
3. A program to reply to emails from that folder/send new emails

The programs we're going to use in this guide are `mbsync` (<ListMarker>1.</ListMarker>), `mu` (<ListMarker>2.</ListMarker>) and `msmtp`(<ListMarker>3.</ListMarker>).

First, we're gonna <Il href="#1-getting-the-system-to-a-state-you-can-start-from">get your system to a state you can start from</Il>, then <Il href="2-">get it to work on the command line</Il>, and only then set it up in [[Doom Emacs]].

## 1. Getting the system to a state you can start from

From here on, this post assumes that you've got:

1. Nix installed
2. <Il href="setting-up-home-manager">Home Manager installed</Il>

(Since you came here you probably know it, but) The [Home Manager Email Options are weird](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-accounts.email.accounts), at least at first.

The way they work is that you define an email account:

```nix
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        address = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        realName = "Beat Hagenlocher";
        userName = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        passwordCommand = "cat ~/.posteopassword";
      };
    };
```

How to access the server for sending and pulling Email:

```nix
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        # ...
        smtp = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 465;
          tls.enable = true;
        };
        imap = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 993;
          tls.enable = true;
        };
      };
    };
```

As well as the configuration options _per account_ for the tools you might use (`mbsync`, `mu`, and `msmtp` for us):

```nix
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        # ...
        mbsync = {
          enable = true;
          create = "both";
          remove = "both";
          expunge = "both";
        };
        mu.enable = true;
        msmtp.enable = true;
      };
    };
```

Taken together:

```nix
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        address = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        realName = "Beat Hagenlocher";
        userName = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        passwordCommand = "cat ~/.posteopassword";
        smtp = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 465;
          tls.enable = true;
        };
        imap = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 993;
          tls.enable = true;
        };

        mbsync = {
          enable = true;
          create = "both";
          remove = "both";
          expunge = "both";
        };
        mu.enable = true;
        msmtp.enable = true;
      };
    };
```

Now, we only need to enable `mbsync`, `mu` and `msmtp`:

```nix
    programs.mbsync.enable = true;
    programs.msmtp.enable = true;
    programs.mu.enable = true;
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      # ...
    };
```

```nix
    programs.mbsync.enable = true;
    programs.msmtp.enable = true;
    programs.mu.enable = true;
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        primary = true;
        address = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        realName = "Beat Hagenlocher";
        userName = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        passwordCommand = "cat ~/.posteopassword";
        signature = {
          text = ''
            Liebe Grüße
            Beat Hagenlocher
          '';
          showSignature = "append";
        };
        smtp = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 465;
          tls.enable = true;
        };
        imap = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 993;
          tls.enable = true;
        };

        mbsync = {
          enable = true;
          create = "both";
          remove = "both";
          expunge = "both";
          patterns = [
            "*"
            "!Drafts"
            "!Deleted Messages"
          ];
        };
        msmtp = {
          enable = true;
        };
      };
    };
```
