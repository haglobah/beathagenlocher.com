1. Learn to touch type _really fast_ (> 120 wpm) while you're young. You can do _everything_ so much faster if you can.
2. Learn to sleep on your back. Everything else won't work in the long run (and result in only unnecessary neck and back pain)
3. When you can't sleep for longer than a few minutes, get up and do something else. Only go to sleep when you're tired.
4. Real Mathematics is wonderful and interesting â€“ don't be disillusioned by the stuff in school that's _called_ maths, but _is_ just calculating stuff.
5. Ask 'adults' (or people that are farther on your journey) for help, pointers, stuff you might find interesting, and most importantly, _pointers_ on whom to ask next.
6. Take the suggestion that you might like this website called LessWrong seriously. You're gonna enjoy it.
