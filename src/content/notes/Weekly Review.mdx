A catalogue of question through which I look back to the last week.

My try to have mid-level view of situations, and a connector between daily [[Journaling]] and 3-monthly [[Microlife Reviews]]

Current questions:

## How do I feel right now? How did I feel over the course of the last week?

## What is/has been on my mind? What kind of questions am I asking myself?

## What about my _large goals_?

## Am I enjoying my life?

## What are the things I do that give me energy? What are things that take it away?

## Do I have a learning? Is there something I'd like to change from now on?
