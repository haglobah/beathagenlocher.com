Mister keyboard made the hold-swipe feature for zooming through the text Pro-only. Aaaah.

Now about a month in, I think I'm settled in:

I've found a keyboard app that actually works well: You can customize Mister Keyboard pretty well, and that is enough for me, for now. I don't want to type _that much_ on my phone either way.

I've got my iPhone 13 mini about a week ago.

- The standard apple keyboard is.. pretty bad? Like, I can't even customize the long keypress behavior bad? How can one type on that without getting crazy?
- The animation speed is unbearably slow, too.
- There's way fewer apps available, but the apps they are have a pretty high quality: Standing out are Spark (Email) and the native apple calendar
- Some apps are also just worse: All the iOS browsers I've tried are way worse than Android counterparts. Not being able to switch tabs via swiping on the address bar is especially annoying. Vivaldi has that at least, so I think I'm gonna settle on it.
- The Widgets are really, really good compared to Android. But maybe that's also due to me not really having them tried out again for a pretty long time?

My old phone died just recently, and so I got forced to make a decision about a new one quite a bit earlier than what I hoped for.

Now, I'm in the process of setting up the new one, which makes for a pretty nice opportunity to reevaluate what I actually want in and need from a phone (and what not, of course).

- add new todos
- tick off todos
- use maps
- use calendar
- call/message people
- research small stuff on the internet

Things I originally didn't want to use it for, but then did:

- pay
- have it as a second factor for
  - banking
  - half of the random apps I've got

And things I did want to use it for, but which I'm less sure about now:

- reading?
- researching bigger stuff?
- accessing and writing email
- have LLM conversations
- be on reddit
- be on linkedin
- be on bluesky

Let's see how that goes.
