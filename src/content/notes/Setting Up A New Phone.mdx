My old phone died just recently, and so I got forced to make a decision about a new one quite a bit earlier than what I hoped for.

Now, I'm in the process of setting up the new one, which makes for a pretty nice opportunity to reevaluate what I actually want in and need from a phone (and what not, of course).

- add new todos
- tick off todos
- use maps
- use calendar
- call/message people
- research small stuff on the internet

Things I originally didn't want to use it for, but then did:

- pay
- have it as a second factor for
  - banking
  - half of the random apps I've got

And things I did want to use it for, but which I'm less sure about now:

- reading?
- researching bigger stuff?
- accessing and writing email
- have LLM conversations
- be on reddit
- be on linkedin
- be on bluesky

Let's see how that goes.
