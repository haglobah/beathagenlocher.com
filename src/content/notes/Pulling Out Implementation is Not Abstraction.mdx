So, you're writing code
1. You notice some sameness in the code you're writing.
2. You know what to do—cause you're a good and responsible programmer!—you pull the sameness out.
3. You call that 'abstraction', are happy with your life, and carry on.

Unfortunately, this is not the whole story.  

Because sometime later someone (probably you) wants to add a behavior to one of the few functions you pulled that code out from.
Turns out the code wasn't similar for a _good reason_—it was only similar _incidentially_.

And now they (that is, you) got a problem—cause they want to you only named the function `withData`

- pulling sameness out => _This is something you should not do!_
- Say "Abstraction"
