A catalogue of question through which I look back to the last twelve weeks, and forward to the next twelve (from a higher vantage point).

My place for assessing and adjusting larger things in life, one level up from the [[Weekly Rewiev]], and below doing a full [[Designing Your Life]] Session.

Normally, this starts by me doing a full [[Weekly Review]] first, and then changing gears to the Microlife Review

Current questions:

## How do I feel right now? How did I feel over the course of the last week?

## What is/has been on my mind? What kind of questions am I asking myself?

## What about my _large goals_?

## Am I enjoying my life?

## What are the things I do that give me energy? What are things that take it away?

## Do I have a learning? Is there something I'd like to change from now on?

## How were my last 12 weeks?

## What am I happy about? What am I unhappy about?

## What would I like to do more of? What would I like to cut back on?

## What are the things I want to throw significant amounts of time and energy at over the next 12 weeks?
