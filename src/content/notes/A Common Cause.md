Societies need a common cause to usefully exist:
- A [[Purpose]] combined with
- [[Task]]s everyone can do/participate in

This creates a feeling of [[Ownership]]â€”and that is exactly what a functioning society needs.

It's also about channeling the ambitions of your ambitious people. When there's no proxy [[Status Game]] to play, they have to tackle the problems themselves. Nice.

Probably a big reason in itself not to create any kind of [[Bureaucracy]]. 

For the [[United States of America|US]], this might have been domesticizing the [[Frontier]]/the [[Industrialization]], but there have been other great tasks, too.
