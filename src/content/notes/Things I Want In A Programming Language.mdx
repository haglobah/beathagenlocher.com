I feel like I'm a simple man and I'm not asking for much.

_[[Programming Languages Are Sets Of Features]]_. And these are the features I'd like to have in a language:

- Pattern matching in every _reasonable binding position_ ([[Elixir Style]])
- Every scope returns its last element (aka. no `return` fuckery)
- Strong and Static Gradual typing with me basically never having to write down types
- explicit modules that can be defined, nested, and imported in the most sensible way
---
- direct interop with JS
- Referential Transparency ()

## Things I'm unsure about

### being able to drop down machine level

- Rust-style or C-style

### lambdas vs non-lambdas

### (parens (syntax))
I think I want Racket-style macros (or at least I see their case pretty clearly, and if you want _any_ Macros, you should have Racket Macros), but I'm way less sure about syntax here.
Elixir's syntax seems to go a long way here.


## Simplicity

## Syntax Likings

- Elixir's syntax, basically.

Is that really too much to ask?
