A .. pretty nice environment to do all of your "generally working with text" stuff in.

Also relatively arcane, complex, and hard to tame.

My recommendation to start using it is definitely [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/tree/master) (which makes things a lot easier in my experience).

You should not, in any way, start using it before having _a proper habit_ of version controlling your config files. (Psst: The easiest way to do that is [[magit]] (running inside [[Emacs]]))
