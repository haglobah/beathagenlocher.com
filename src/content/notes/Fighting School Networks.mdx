Just recently, I taught a course at a [Deutsche Sch√ºlerAkademie](https://www.schuelerakademien.de/deutsche-schuelerakademie) and had access to and troubles with a school network.

I always knew they would be troublesome, but when I last had to live in one, I didn't have both of needs and knowledge to do anything about it.

This time, I've encountered the following problems:

# Websites connect only after a very long time

Reason: The network can disable IPv6 traffic (or just not speak it at all)

Apparently Windows still only uses IPv4, so they experience any issues.

Solution: You need to disable IPv6 either for the network, or on your device in general (if you're one of the non-stupid clients)

# I lost internet access permanently (across all of Wifi on/off, reconnects and restarts)

# I regularly lost the connection (Wifi on/off did resolve that)

# `ssh`, `SMB` & others didn't work at all
