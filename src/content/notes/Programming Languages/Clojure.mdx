A pretty nice [[Programming Language]] created by [[Rich Hickey]].

Is at the same time **great** (partly because of its communities' focus on simplicity, elegance, and so on) and **really painful to use**—because they're just not able to consistently follow through with it.

Some examples:
- They know that [[Coupling]] is bad, and regularly point it out – but somehow aren't able to see where they're introducing it unnecessarily. Example: You can have only one namespace per file, the namespace name must align with the file location in the project tree, _and_ namespace and file name must follow different styles: `main/this_app.clj` becomes `(ns main.this-app)`. Please, what?
