Over the last few days, I've plunged into finally trying to understand how all of this Auth stuff works.

(The landscape of Acronyms is almost as bad as with the [CORS one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YJ-yhoJh2I))

These are the videos/sites I would've liked to find from the beginning on:

- [The Auth Wiki from Logto](https://auth-wiki.logto.io/), but only as a reference whenever some word is unclear (though that has duplicate pages for some reason)
- [Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OIDC (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t18YB3xDfXI)
- [Everything you ever wanted to know about OAuth and OICD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aCyojTIW6U) (though the mentions OAuth playground is currently broken, or so it seems)
- [OAuth 2 Simplified (Blog Post)](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/), which has been expanded into [OAuth 2 Simplified (Book)](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/getting-ready/)
- [OAuth Playground](https://www.oauth.com/playground/)
- [Auth0Alternatives](https://www.auth0alternatives.com/)

# Not super-intuitive stuff

- A normal web client shouldn't have a client secret (makes sense if you think about it), and needs to use [[PKCE]]
- OAuth is only about _Authorization_ (read: Authorizing the service you're currently logging in to to access some resources on another service), OpenId Connect (OIDC) adds _Authentication_ (read: telling the service you're currently logging into who you are) to this.
- In my head, every service supporting OAuth (or OIDC, at least) also supported something called "Public Sign Up". But that's not the case, most of them actually don't (which makes sense, because _Authorization_ and _Registration_ don't even belong to the same area)
