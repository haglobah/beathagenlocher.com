<Draft>

There's two pretty helpful variables you can gauge problems on:

One of them is Certainty/Uncertainty, the other Simplicity/Complexity.

|         | certain     | uncertain        |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| simple  | Engineering | Design Thinking  |
| complex | ???         | Systems Thinking |

- most of the interesting problems in this world (to me) are inside the uncertain and/or complex areas
- most of the solutions to those problems
