The big players here seem to be [immer]() and [immutable.js]() (reference: [weekly downloads on npm](https://npmx.dev/compare?packages=immer,structurajs,mutative,immutable)).

And they got lots of weekly downloads. I'm almost wondering whether its the same thing all over again: Tell software engineers about functional programming, and they don't want to hear anything more, but tell them about any of the constituent parts, they see the value and want to use it.
