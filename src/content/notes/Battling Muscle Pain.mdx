It's prettly simple, actually.

[[Repetitive Strain Injury]], <Il href="battling-neck-pain">Neck Pain</Il>, [[Lower Back Pain]]â€”all the same.

But that's not to say it's easy.

For every Muscle Pain I've encountered so far, I've had to:

1. reduce strain
2. relax the muscle
3. strengthen the muscle (or its antagonist)

So, to make it more explicit:

Whenever you have any muscle ache from tension or whatever, the way to go is the following:

1. Find out what the straining activities are, and limit them
2. Find out what helps immediately, and do it (like blackrolling, stretching, taking a break)
3. Find out what helps mid- to longterm: This is almost all of the times some kind of training, maybe also fixing your posture through awareness (and training)

## 1. Reducing Strain: Make out the stressors and battle them

## 2. Relaxing the Muscle

For me, that normally amounts to:

- [[Blackrolling]] the muscle
- Tightening up its antagonist
- Adjusting my posture
- Stretching the muscle


## 3. Strengthening the Muscle

Find exercises that are:

- easy to do correcly
- thoroughly check your posture
- ask training-people you know for advice
