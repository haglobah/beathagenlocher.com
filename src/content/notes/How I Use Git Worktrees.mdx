I've known about [[git worktree]]s for quite some time now, but they never really clicked.
Then, I came upon this pretty good article here ([How I Use Git Worktrees](https://matklad.github.io/2024/07/25/git-worktrees.html)) and it resonates pretty well. You should definitely go read it, but the gist is this:

The author proposes to use one worktree per concurrent activity while coding.

And that finally clicked. This is my workflow for any git repo now:

```shell
~/projects $ gc https://github.com/haglobah/beathagenlocher.git
~/projects/beathagenlocher.com/work/ $ # change stuff
~/projects/beathagenlocher.com/work/ $ wt remote #

~/projects/beathagenlocher.com/remote/ $ # run tests on main
~/projects/beathagenlocher.com/remote/ $ wt scratch


~/projects/beathagenlocher.com/scratch/ $ #
# ... and so on
```

The magic lies in the two commands [`gc`](https://github.com/haglobah/nix-home/blob/d8bfa58c211cf2e03602d99b30f11dfe191c01ae/programs/fish.nix#L169) and [`wt`](https://github.com/haglobah/nix-home/blob/d8bfa58c211cf2e03602d99b30f11dfe191c01ae/programs/fish.nix#L193).

There are quite a few articles on the internet lining out issues when using worktrees—mostly related to their bare version. (Two good ones [here](https://morgan.cugerone.com/blog/how-to-use-git-worktree-and-in-a-clean-way/) and [here](https://morgan.cugerone.com/blog/workarounds-to-git-worktree-using-bare-repository-and-cannot-fetch-remote-branches/).)

Pretty hacky.

And it's a hard problem—You (probably) want to have this kind of structure:

```shell
example-project
|- remote
|- scratch
|- work
```

while at the same time not having all of these branch checkout issues.

Turns out the solution is pretty simple. You can just do this:

```shell
git clone <repo> example-project/work
cd exaple-project/work
git worktree add ../remote
git worktree add ../scratch
```

Yes, worktrees can refer to `.git/` folders from anywhere on your system. They don't have to go up the tree.
Maybe that was obvious for you—for me, it wasn't.

With this approach, you have the best of all possible worlds.

You have one standard repo as your `work` repo (that also works for any tool assuming a `.git/` folder and breaking on `.git` file), and worktrees however you want them (while preserving this nice repo structure.)

Really the only disadvantage is that you can't interact with your repo from you top-level project folder anymore—but that's a price I'm willing to pay.

:)
