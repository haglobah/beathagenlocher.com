For doing this, you first need to own a Domain.

You can do this for example at Cloudflare: https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/register-domain/

But seriously, just go with whatever "domain registar reddit" suggests when you're reading this.

After having a domain registered, you can add a DNS record to this domain.

Let's say you have a server with a public IP (like `1.12.234.45`), and want to have a service available on "photos.your.domain". Then you need to do this:

1. Choose the A record type
2. Set the name to "photos"
3. Set the IPv6 address to `1.12.234.45`

And that's it. :)
