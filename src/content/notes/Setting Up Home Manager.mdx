So, you want to have a `~` where [[works on my system]] is a thing of the past?

You've come to the right place.

In this tutorial, I'm gonna show you how to set up your `HOME` with [[Home Manager]] using [[Nix Flakes]] on Linux.

First things first: Take one minute and look at the [docs](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml). They're not a tutorial, but a good reference, and it's definitely useful to have seen them once.


...

# Chapter 1: A Basic Flake

With that out of the way—you first need to make sure you have [[Nix]] installed:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Then, you need a place to store your [[Home Manager]] configuration.
Create a folder for it (name doesn't matter) and a `flake.nix` inside (name does matter). Then, let's start writing your configuration inside the `flake.nix`:

```shell
mkdir ~/nix-home
cd ~/nix-home
code flake.nix # or whatever editor you prefer
```

The first thing our Home Manager <Il href="nix-flakes">Flake</Il> needs is a _input_ to get packages from. We're probably going to use some packages, so we need [[`nixpkgs`]], and then we're going to use `home-manager`, too:

```nix showLineNumbers title=flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable"; # nixpkgs input
    home-manager.url {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";         # home manager input
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";                # that takes the versions from our nixpkgs checkout
    };
  };
}
```

Then, we need to specify how to build the home configuration—we do that inside an _output_.
For it to work, you need to know your _username_ (in case you don't know it, do a `whoami` in the shell).

So for me, _`beat`_, this would look like this:

```nix showLineNumbers title=flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable"; # nixpkgs input
    home-manager.url {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";         # home manager input
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";                # that takes the versions from our nixpkgs checkout
    };
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, home-manager, ... }:              # nix function syntax
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    homeConfigurations."beat" = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      inherit pkgs;

      modules = [
        config = {
          home.username = "beat";
          home.homeDirectory = "/home/beat";

          # DO NOT CHANGE THESE LINES
          programs.home-manager.enable = true;
          home.stateVersion = "25.05";
        };
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Now's finally the time to actually add things to your config.
You can find all of the _Home Manager Configuration Options_ here: https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml

This is a website you're probably gonna visit _a lot_ over the course of the next few months.

But enough of that—time to add some packages. We can take whatever [there is in nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages).
Let's add `git` and `wget`:

```nix showLineNumbers startLineNumber=19 title=flake.nix
# ... start of flake
config = {
  home.username = "beat";
  home.homeDirectory = "/home/beat";

  home.packages = [
    pkgs.git
    pkgs.wget
  ];

  # DO NOT CHANGE THESE LINES
  programs.home-manager.enable = true;
  home.stateVersion = "25.05";
};
# ... closing braces
```

And with that, time for our first rebuild.
Let's test that everything worked by checking where the `git` executable comes from. So, run this first:

```shell
which git
/usr/bin/git
```

Rebuild your `HOME`:

```shell
cd ~/nix-home
nix run home-manager/master -- switch --flake .
```

After it's done, close and reopent the terminal once. Then, do `which git` again—it should say something like this:

```shell
which git
~/.nix-profile/bin/git
```

Now you know how to add packages declaratively and reproducibly to your `HOME`. Yay!

# Intermezzo: Version Control

Before we go any further, it's time give us some more safety trying things out.
For that, we put our `~/nix-home` under _Version Control_.

Make sure you have <Il href="setting-up-git">`git` set up</Il>.

Create a repository called `~/nix-home`.

Copy the _SSH_ link from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-an-empty-repository).

It should look like this: `git@github.com:<username>/nix-home.git`

Then, go back to your shell and do the following:

```shell
cd ~/nix-home
git init --initial-branch=main
git remote add origin <the-link-you-just-copied>
git add flake.nix
git commit --message "Initial commit with wget and git"
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

But since this is not a `git` tutorial, let's move on.

(The [git flight rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) are pretty decent.)

# Chapter 2: Transferring your `HOME`

So far, the benefits of using home manager have been pretty much limited.
I've promised no more [[Works on my Machine]] issues, remember?

To do that, it's time to pull in your whole `HOME` config into your flake.

Let's do it for the `bash` files, `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc`:

1. Find the files:
    ```shell
    $ cd ~
    $ ls -a
    .bash_profile .bashrc
    ```
2. Copy them over:
    ```shell
    $ cp .bash_profile .bashrc ~/nix-home/
    ```
3. Add them to `home.file`:
    ```nix showLineNumbers startLineNumber=19 title=flake.nix
    # ... start of flake
    config = {
      home.username = "beat";
      home.homeDirectory = "/home/beat";

      home.packages = [
        pkgs.git
        pkgs.wget
      ];

      home.file = {
        ".bash_profile".source = ./.bash_profile;
        ".bashrc".source = ./.bashrc;
      };

      # DO NOT CHANGE THESE LINES
      programs.home-manager.enable = true;
      home.stateVersion = "25.05";
    };
    # ... closing braces
    ```
4. And rebuild your `HOME` _while backing up the old files_:
    ```shell
    home-manager switch --flake ~/nix-home -b backup
    ```



This general workflow works for every file in your `HOME`:

1. Take any file in your `HOME` that looks like it might serve a purpose (possibly everything in `.config`, `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.vimrc` and basically any other dotfile)
2. Copy the file over to `~/nix-home/<the-file-path>`
3. Add the file to `home.file`
4. Rebuild you `HOME`

# Chapter 3: Using modules

Let's recap for a bit.

So far, [[Home Manager]] made our system nice and reproducible, but we didn't get _that_ much in return.  
We mostly added a layer of declarativeness around the packages we installed while preserving their own configurations.

The true power of [[Home Manager]] only comes when using _modules_. Because everything is reproducible, there are plenty of prepackages software packages that hardly need any effort to use already available.

Let me show you:

After

But git is something we also want to have configured

This is now pretty similar to what we would've gotten in case we would've just generated the config. Do a

```shell
nix run home-manager/master -- init ~/nix-home-2
```

and compare the result.
