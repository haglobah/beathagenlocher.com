A course I taught on learning at [Schülerakademie](https://www.schuelerakademien.de/deutsche-schuelerakademie) Roßleben 2022:

Started with Neuroanatomy basics, then moved on to the psychology of learning, and concluded with applying the learned things to learning a programming language ([[Racket]], of course ^^)

Interleaved with generally useful inputs on

- how to read a paper
- finding good papers on a topic
- how to do good presentations
