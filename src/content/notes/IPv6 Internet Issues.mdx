For the second time in a few months, I've had a pretty annoying experience regarding computer networks:

I had internet access, but websites would take ages to load.

Turns out that there's routers that just don't support IPv6 _at all_.

But my OS always tries to establish an IPv6 connection first, backs off for a bit, and then falls back to IPv4, which then works.

So if:

- websites take relatively long to resolve, but then load fast
- but pings are fast `ping github.com`

You might want to check whether IPv6 works:

```shell
curl --verbose -4 github.com # should resolve
curl --verbose -6 github.com # should break if IPv6 is the issue
```

Then you need to somehow disable IPv6 to resolve those long loading times.

What worked on NixOS for me was the nuclear optionâ€”disabling IPv6 in the kernel:

```nix
# in configuration.nix
config = {
  boot.kernelParams = [ "ipv6.disable=1" ];
}
```
