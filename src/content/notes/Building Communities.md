> Building a community is like building a startup.

What do I mean by that?

- It's a [[High-uncertainty problem]] you can (and should) tackle with all the high-uncertainty problem solving methods available (aka. [[Startup Methods]])
- You don't care _at all_ about pleasing the general public. You want to create the strongest enthusiasm possible in the largest group of people—but when you need to/want to choose (and you will need to choose), you want to pick the greater enthusiasm for the smaller amount of people. _Always._
- Your success depends on the [[Subculture]] Creators you draw to it. You want to make sure your message reaches and activates them.

> Building a community means building a garden.

You want and need to create a space a certain subgroup of people really enjoys, and then is able to spend time under the social rules you (the initial group) set up in it. It can change with time, of course.

Seems reasonable, right? Yet it has two not-so-easy-to-get-right parts about it.

1. It's important that some people _really enjoy_ being there. Otherwise, _nobody_ will come. 
2. To make that happen, there have to be _some_ rules (be they explicit or implicit, social or otherwise). What is important is not what they are, but that you enforce them. If you don't fight for it, your [[Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism|garden will die]].

And [[Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism]]. Meaning _you need to be very, very clear_ about whom to allow in and to participate and whom you don't allow in.

Normally, if you already got found by some people, 1. is not the problem. I'm worrying you'll fail at the second one.

For enforcing the rules, you 1) _need to know them_ and 2) be prepared to defend them.

In the case of the [[School of Moral Amibition]], you have the rules and know them.

How do you prepare to defend them? You collect every instance of someone that didn't fit/alienated people, and.

From the onboarding, I think can out the following prototypes:

1. People that don't want to actually work on the cause, but only be part of the community (MOPs in [[Subculture]] terms)
2. People that only want to find people for their own cause—and not contribute to this one
3. People that only want to show off (consciously or unconsciously)

And, coincidentially: All of them are also people that make it on average less joyful for the ones that _are_ morally ambitious to participate in the community.

So, [[Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism|defend your garden]].
