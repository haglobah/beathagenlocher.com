- random accumulated weirdnesses no one bothers to fix:  `head` throwing, Overloaded strings, basically everything [[NeoHaskell]] wants to address.
- incredibly big language (/combinatorial ecosystem hell!)
- weird beginner edge cases
- too little docs, only types

Many of these probably stem from mostly seniors, little engineers and definitely no (small-d) (UX) designers using the language.
