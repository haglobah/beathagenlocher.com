At the [[LessWrong Community Weekend 2025]], I learned of a cool thing:
People declare that they operate by [Crocker's Rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html).
This means that they have conceded the right to be offended by you (for being ... \<insert anything here\>)

The idea is that when having a conversation with them, and you think you could convey information in a faster way but at the expense of social etiquette or whatever, _you can just do so_, because that's what they asked you to do.

Isn't that amazing?
