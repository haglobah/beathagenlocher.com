Welcome!

This is a collection of things you might need using <Il href="./programming-languages/clojure">Clojure</Il>—and how I resolve them.

# Help, I forgot the Java/JS interop syntax—again!

# I want to print a value inside a function call stack

Assume your code looks like this:

```clojure showLineNumbers title=main.clj
(defn make-other-thing []
  (produce-other-thing (filter-things-out (transform-thing-to-things (make-thing)))))
```

But now, you want to take a look at the result of transform-thing-to-things without interfering with the rest of the function.

This would be the naive approach:

```clojure showLineNumbers title=main.clj
(defn make-other-thing []
  (let [things (transform-thing-to-things (make-thing))]
    (println things)
    (produce-other-thing (filter-things-out things))))
```

But I think this is way better:

```clojure showLineNumbers title=main.clj
(defn inspect [thing]
  (println thing)
  thing)

(defn make-other-thing []
  (produce-other-thing (filter-things-out (inspect (transform-thing-to-things (make-thing))))))
```

Or even:

```clojure showLineNumbers title=main.clj
(defn inspect [thing]
  (println thing)
  thing)

(defn make-other-thing []
  (-> (make-thing)
      transform-thing-to-things
      inspect
      filter-things-out
      produce-other-thing))
```

And since `inspect` is a function that probably should've been in the standard library—we put it in our `utils` namespace:

```clojure showLineNumbers title=utils/debug.clj
(ns example.utils.debug)

(defn inspect [thing]
  (println thing)
  thing)
```

```clojure showLineNumbers title=main.clj
(ns example.main
  (:require
    [example.utils.debug :refer [inspect]]))

(defn make-other-thing []
  (-> (make-thing)
      transform-thing-to-things
      inspect
      filter-things-out
      produce-other-thing))
```

# `...` not found on classpath. Help!

1. Check the spelling of the thing you want to include.
   1. Really check it.
   2. In every place.

If it's not the spelling, it's probably one of the following:

- The resource exists with the right name, but is not actually on the classpath.
  - Is it in the right folder? That is, with your `:paths` looking like this (`{:paths ["src" "test" "resources"] ...}`), is it in either `./src`, `./test` or`./resourcer` from the project root?
  - Did you add the folder to the classpath? ->


# I struggle with creating the right namespace layout. Help!
