One and a half weeks ago, I attended the [LessWrong community weekend 2025](https://www.lesswrong.com/events/JxsdDs8ZfbF4dBkGe/lesswrong-community-weekend-2025) and had an amazing time there.

Something happens when you put a bunch of people whose only shared characteristic is working hard to be less wrong about things.

## What

- I learned how to play [Penultimate Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penultima)
- Someone hit me up to talk about something in Decision Theory they'd been thinking about.
- I ate _the most amazing snacks I've encountered at an event, ever_. I normally bring loads of my own snacks (mostly nuts) to events I attend (cause their ones aren't _that_ good)â€”this time I didn't even open them.
- I attended a session on [[Community Building]], one 

## Ground Rules

It had really good [[Ground Rules]]:

1. Pacman Rule
2. Discuss to learn, not to convince
3. 1-on-1
4. Rest
5. Make it happen
6. Allow be weird
