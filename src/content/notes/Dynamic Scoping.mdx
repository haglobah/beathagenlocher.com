> [[Lexical Scoping]] refers to when the location of a function's definition determines which variables you have access to. On the other hand, [[Dynamic Scoping]] uses the location of the function's invocation to determine which variables are available.

```racket title=dyn-scope.rkt
#lang smol/dyn-scope-is-bad

(defvar y 2)
(deffun (times-2 x)
    (* y x))

(let ([y 3])
  (times-2 2))
(times-2 2)
```

Evaluation:

```racket
6
4
```

Well, this is bad.
