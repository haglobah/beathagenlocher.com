- Open and close the inbuilt shell with Cmd+j, Ctrl+j, or Ctrl+ö
- Make the `keybindings.json` your own: Add at least one special keybinding (maybe a word you type often when programming—`lambda` or `class`, maybe?)
- Adding a new file is super annoying. Add a shortcut for creating one:
```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+n",
    "command": "explorer.newFile",
}
```
