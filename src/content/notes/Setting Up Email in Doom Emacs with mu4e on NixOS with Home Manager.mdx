On some days I feel like I've dug my own grave.

My day started out in a pretty innocent way. I'm currently reading [[The Great CEO Within]], and came across a section on [[Getting Things Done]] especially tailored towards [[Email]].  
Having an [[Email Client]] + workflow I can halfway be productive with is something that's been on my mind for quite some time.  
So I gave it another try—and immediately remembered why I've stopped the last few times.

What this boils down to for me is that:
1. [[Email]] itself is tech-wise insanely complex and hard to work with
2. It comes from a very different world. _In this world_, it has [inherent and fatal flaws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrGfahzt-4Q)

and incentives around it make basically any startup with a decent personal offering [pivot to business customers](https://superhuman.com/pricing) pretty fast. ([or just get bought](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Running-a-Startup-on-Haskell/))

## What I Want

What I want is:

1. That it "just works"
2. Decent speed
3. Customizable keybindings
4. Generally affordable (\<= 5$/month)
5. Tight integration into my other workflows  

## What the World looks like

I think you can put Email Clients in three buckets:

A. free GUI apps (e.g. Thunderbird)  
B. paid apps (e.g. Superhuman)  
C. free Terminal clients, and their Emacs/NeoVim counterparts  (e.g. `mu`, `notmuch`)

For <ListMarker>1.</ListMarker> ("just works"-ness):
- free GUI apps work, but those are:  
  - barely customizable (failing <ListMarker>3.</ListMarker>)
  - and tend to be slow (failing <ListMarker>2.</ListMarker>)
- paid apps work
- free terminal clients just don't

For <ListMarker>2.</ListMarker> and <ListMarker>3.</ListMarker>, there's:
- [[TUI]]/[[Emacs]] stuff, but that fails <ListMarker>1.</ListMarker>
- paid apps work
- free apps don't

The paid apps fail <ListMarker>4.</ListMarker>, and tight integration (<ListMarker>5.</ListMarker>) is hard to achieve basically anywhere except for [[Emacs]] or my shell.

This left me with either paying a lot for "just works"-ness and speed, or finally spending the time to understand Email, setting up something in my shell, and using it from [[Emacs]].  
That taken together makes it a pretty daunting task.

But this time, it didn't stop me.

## Understanding Email

To work with [[Email]], you need three things:

1. A program to sync your email from a server to a local folder
2. A program to read/view/search your email from that folder
3. A program to reply to emails from that folder/send new emails

The programs we're going to use in this guide are `mbsync` (<ListMarker>1.</ListMarker>), `mu` (<ListMarker>2.</ListMarker>) and `msmtp`(<ListMarker>3.</ListMarker>).

First, we're gonna <Il href="#1-getting-the-system-to-a-state-you-can-start-from">get your system to a state you can start from</Il>, then <Il href="2-">get it to work on the command line</Il>, and only then set it up in [[Doom Emacs]].

## 1. Getting the system to a state you can start from

From here on, this post assumes that you've got:

1. Nix installed
2. <Il href="setting-up-home-manager">Home Manager installed</Il>

(Since you came here you probably know it, but) The [Home Manager Email Options are weird](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-accounts.email.accounts), at least at first.

The way they work is that you define an email account:

```nix
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        address = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        realName = "Beat Hagenlocher";
        userName = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        passwordCommand = "cat ~/.posteopassword";
      };
    };
```

How to access the server for sending and pulling Email:

```nix
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        # ...
        smtp = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 465;
          tls.enable = true;
        };
        imap = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 993;
          tls.enable = true;
        };
      };
    };
```

As well as the configuration options _per account_ for the tools you might use (`mbsync`, `mu`, and `msmtp` for us):

```nix
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        # ...
        mbsync = {
          enable = true;
          create = "both";
          remove = "both";
          expunge = "both";
        };
        mu.enable = true;
        msmtp.enable = true;
      };
    };
```

Taken together:

```nix
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        address = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        realName = "Beat Hagenlocher";
        userName = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        passwordCommand = "cat ~/.posteopassword";
        smtp = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 465;
          tls.enable = true;
        };
        imap = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 993;
          tls.enable = true;
        };

        mbsync = {
          enable = true;
          create = "both";
          remove = "both";
          expunge = "both";
        };
        mu.enable = true;
        msmtp.enable = true;
      };
    };
```

Now, we only need to enable `mbsync`, `mu` and `msmtp`:

```nix
    programs.mbsync.enable = true;
    programs.msmtp.enable = true;
    programs.mu.enable = true;
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      # ...
    };
```

Taken together:

```nix
    programs.mbsync.enable = true;
    programs.msmtp.enable = true;
    programs.mu.enable = true;
    accounts.email.accounts = {
      posteo = {
        primary = true;
        address = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        realName = "Beat Hagenlocher";
        userName = "hagenlob@posteo.de";
        passwordCommand = "cat ~/.posteopassword";
        signature = {
          text = ''
            Liebe Grüße
            Beat Hagenlocher
          '';
          showSignature = "append";
        };
        smtp = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 465;
          tls.enable = true;
        };
        imap = {
          host = "posteo.de";
          port = 993;
          tls.enable = true;
        };

        mbsync = {
          enable = true;
          create = "both";
          remove = "both";
          expunge = "both";
          patterns = [
            "*"
            "!Drafts"
            "!Deleted Messages"
          ];
        };
        msmtp = {
          enable = true;
        };
      };
    };
```

Now a simple

```shell
home-manager switch --flake ~/nix-home/
```

and you should be good to go.

And since [[Nix]] sprinkles everything it touches with magic "works on every machine" sauce, this (minus correct configuration for your Email provider) should work on your machine, too.

Happy mailing :)

...

Actually, not yet.

There's still the whole [[Doom Emacs]] part to be resolved.

This is what my config for that looks like:  
https://github.com/haglobah/doom/blob/c4004efa3c1f9cac71252dead8f2b2765142e290/config/email.el#L5

(The workflow-relevant part being [the bookmarks](https://github.com/haglobah/doom/blob/c4004efa3c1f9cac71252dead8f2b2765142e290/config/email.el#L29) and [this horrendous `kmacro`-fuckery](https://github.com/haglobah/doom/blob/c4004efa3c1f9cac71252dead8f2b2765142e290/config/email.el#L77C1-L92C8))

If you squint a bit, you can see the [[Getting Things Done]] influence there.

But that's for another time.

Now, finally: Happy Mailing!
