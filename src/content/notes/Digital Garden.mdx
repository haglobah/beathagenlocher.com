[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com) is putting it best:

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organised by their publication date. They’re inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren’t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They’re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we’re used to seeing. ([source](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history))

Digital gardens are—maybe—how the web should've turned out to be.

They're the opposite of the Stream.
