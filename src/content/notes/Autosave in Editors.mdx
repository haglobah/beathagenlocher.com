I think you very, very unambigiously want autosave in editors.

# Emacs

This is how you do it in [[Doom Emacs]]:

```elisp
(setq auto-save-visited-interval 0.1)
(auto-save-visited-mode t)
(global-auto-revert-mode t)
(setq! doom-modeline-buffer-modification-icon nil)
```

# Neovim

For Neovim, there's the `auto-save` package:

```lua
{
    "Pocco81/auto-save.nvim",
    config = function()
       require("auto-save").setup {
        -- your config goes here
        -- or just leave it empty :)
       }
    end,
  }
```

# VS Code

For VS Code, it's super easy. Just search the settings for autosave :)
