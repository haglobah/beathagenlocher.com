# Install Nix

The [installer on the website](https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-linux) sucks (doesn't work with SELinux, for example), but there is a community-maintained one:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://artifacts.nixos.org/nix-installer | sh -s -- install
```

With that completed, go write your first [[Nix Flake]]
