I'm currently dealing with neck pain—again.

I've just been getting well again after a cold, when my neck started to hurt horrendously.

And this isn't crazily bad—I've been used to have this pretty regularly—but at the same time I'm only good at battling it after I've just dealt with this.

The basic principles for [[Battling Muscle Pain]] apply.

So here comes the guide for future me:

## Taking Precautions

Don't do (after illness/when feeling tense):

- [Arnie Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ml7BH7mNwQ)

Do:

- rotate your pelvis
- tighten your belly
- straighten up: Your chest should be very open (at a relatively high point)


## Battling the Pain

Okay, you've got there. Shite.  
But what can you do?

Do all of the dos from <Il href="battling-neck-pain#taking-precautions">Taking Precautions</Il>

But in addition to that: [[Blackroll]] the shit out of your body.

- The inside of your chest
- Your lower chest
- Your upper chest
- The front of your delta muscle
- The side of your delta muscle
- Your lower back
- Your upper back
- Your latissimus
- Your hip from the back
- Your quadriceps at the hip
- Your quadriceps at the knee
- Your calves
- Your feet

And as soon as you're able to do some kind of proper-ish training again:

## Strengthen your muscles.

- Do [Gymnastic Bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(exercise))
- Do [Shrugs](https://modusx.de/fitness-uebungen/shrugs/)
- Stretch your latissimus
- Stretch your chest: Hands together behind your back, and go.

But most of it all: Be compassionate with yourself:

> "Hey man, [I'm sorry you feel that way](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/in-defense-of-im-sorry-you-feel-that).
> I've been there before.  
> Try to make the best out of it, will you?"
