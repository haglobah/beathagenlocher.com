# Help! The power socket doesn't work!

If a few of the following apply:

1. The power socket feels.. _fragile_.
2. You're sitting at a table
3. You're trying to charge your device via a 'small' phone charger/Mac Charger, and not a bigger Schuko Charger

Then it's probable that the sockets have been worn out by the slightly bigger Schuko chargers, and you need to use one of them as well.

# Help! My Wifi doesn't work!

1. Do you have a Docker installation on your laptop?
-> DB seems to sometimes use one of the IPs the Docker Daemon uses, which results in a conflict, which renders the wifi nonfunctional

- Possible solution #1: Disable Docker for the Time being
- Possible solution #2: Make the Docker Daemon use another IP (you apparently can configure something like that, I haven't researched it yet.)
