In the long run, I think I want to have a [[Digital Garden]]. In the short run, I'm _that_ close to ditching [[Ship 30 for 30]] for it.

My desire to write online is much more about being able to express ideas and being able to point people to properly-articulated thougths than it is about getting a business out of it.

Because this is why I started it: To get better at writing, yes, but more specifically to get clear about what I want to write about.
