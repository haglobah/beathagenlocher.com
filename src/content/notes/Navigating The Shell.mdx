Programming-wise, one of the things that stayed a mystery for me the longest was how to navigate a shell effectively and efficiently.

I knew the very basics from relatively early on (my dad had an old MS-DOS PC), but my skills didn't really improve I until after I'd learned to use my first few [[Programming Language]]s effectively. That was way later than it needed to be.

And as it turns out with most things programmingâ€”it's not even that hard, just a lot. And, you get to know how to actually _do stuff_ in return.

In case you want to, this is a pretty good starting point:
