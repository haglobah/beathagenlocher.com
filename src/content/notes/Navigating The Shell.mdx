Programming-wise, one of the things that stayed a mystery for me the longest was how to navigate a shell effectively and efficiently.

I knew the very basics from relatively early on (my dad had an on MS-DOS PC), but that then didn't really improve by much until I'd already learned to use a few [[Programming Language]]s effectively.

And as it turns out with most things programmingâ€”it's not even that hard (only a lot, and you got to know _how to do stuff_).
