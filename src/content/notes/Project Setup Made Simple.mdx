I'm regularly starting projects in old and new [[Programming Languages]], with old and new tools, and in old and new frameworks.

And it used to be the case that just setting the damn thing up took me already ages.

Since [[Progress Happens In Jumps]], there have been a few big jumps along the way.

1. Using [[Linux]]: Basically all the interesting software development happens on Linux, so [[README]]s are geared towards that.
2. Reproducibility, Part #1: Using [[Docker]] whenever possible. This definitely adds complexity, but makes everything _way more reproducible_. [[Runs on my machine]]-type errors should be few now.
3. Reproducibility, Part #2: Enter [[Nix(OS)]]â€”remove the complexity [[Docker]] added, but replace it with learning a whole ecosystem whose good part of the documentation isn't properly indexed/available by Google.
4. Uniformity: All my flakes use [[flake.parts]].
5. Speed, Part #1 | Setup: Setting everything up with [[Nix Flake]]s is fine, but it's tedious to write them by hand in the beginning of every project. Enter [[Flake Templates]]:  
   [[Nix Flake]]s can define a template folder output that then gets copied to whereever you want. When you want to start a new project ([[Pollen]], in this case), you can just do this:
   ```shell
   mkdir pollen-project
   cd pollen-project
   nix flake init --template github:haglobah/flakes#pollen
   ```
6. Speed, Part #2 | Development: Writing and maintaining those [[Flake Templates]], however, is a pain in the ass.  
   Flake Templates just aren't made for the usecase I'm trying to use them for. Which is why I wrote a new, small utility that just works: [[Templater]].
