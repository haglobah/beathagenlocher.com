So you want to use `git` like a pro but are helplessly overwhelmed?

As sorry as I am to say, that's pretty standard.

How about some help?

To get to a working `git` setup you can use , you need a few things:

1. An `ssh` key pair
2. `git` installed
3. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (or any other git repository service, but let's not overcomplicate this)
4. Your ssh key deposited on [GitHub](https://github.com/)  

# 1. Generating the ssh key pair

You get your ssh keys by running

```shell
ssh-keygen
```

followed by a few `<RET>`s.

> _Do not use a passphrase._

Now, you should have two new files in `.ssh`, `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`:

```shell
ls ~/.ssh
known_hosts id_ed25519 id_ed25519.pub
```

Done.

# 2. Install git

My favorite method is via [[Nix]], but please just refer to [git's home page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

# 3. Get a GitHub account

Pretty simple: Go [here](https://github.com/signup) and follow the process.

# 4. Set up ssh for GitHub

Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account).

And then, check that everything works:

```shell
ssh git@github.com # should greet you nicely
```

And that's it. Nice! :)
