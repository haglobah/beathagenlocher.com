I think I've originally encountered this phrase when reading [[Designing Your Life]], but it also just may have been mentioned at one of the [[Design Thinking]] workshops at [[rootlinks]].

Well, means what it says:

It describes a way of working where you very continuously and transparently show what you're doing, how you're doing it, and so on.

This [[Digital Garden]] is my try at it.
