_The_ tool to manage homelabs.

Provides a really nice CLI over standard [[NixOS]] stuff, like setting up a new server, `ssh`ing onto the server, handling secrets management for all of your machines, setting up users everywhere, backing up state from your machines, and so on.

`Clan services` (services that span multiple machines are also pretty nice.)

Secrets are handled via the `var` abstraction. This lets us write _generators_ for secrets so that they mostly already come prepackaged with the service one is using.

# Useful commands

```yaml
machines: [formenos]
```

## ssh onto a machine

```shell
clan ssh formenos
```

## Show machines

```shell
clan machines list
```

## Update a machine

```shell
clan machines update formenos
```

## Show the value of a secret

```shell
clan vars list formenos
# (pick one)
clan vars list root-password/password
```
