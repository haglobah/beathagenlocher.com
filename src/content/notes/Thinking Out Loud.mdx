Hi! ðŸ‘‹

You somehow came upon this website and clicked at one of the weird links at the top. Whew!

This is my online place where I think, work and write <Il href="work-with-the-garage-door-up">with the garage door up</Il>, my [[Digital Garden]].
Following from the working with the garage door up, many of the texts here areâ€”to quote [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/xanadu-patterns/)â€”_haphazard, disjointed, and nonsensical_.  
In other words: Very much a work in progress.  

I'll try my best to indicate how (un-)finished things are, while at the same time making them available to see: You'll notice that there are plenty of posts grayed out or sections indicated as a [[Draft in Progress]].

<Draft>
The level of draftiness 

Also, you're probably going to notice that things move around
