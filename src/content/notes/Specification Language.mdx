A formal language like a programming language, but for writing specifications (how something should behave) compared to programs (what a computer should do).

They get interpreted by programs, however.

Examples I know (of) are [L4](https://l4.legalese.com/) and [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html).
