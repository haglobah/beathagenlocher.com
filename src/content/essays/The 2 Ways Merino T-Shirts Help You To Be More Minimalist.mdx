Not that long ago, I was dismissive towards Merino T-Shirts:

- "Why would anybody spend 80€ plus for a T-Shirt?"
- "It has to be an accessoire for people who need to spend money to get themselves to go hiking."

Then, I realized something: Merino T-Shirts are **more versatile** than cotton ones, are **five T-Shirts in one**, and with that, **a real alternative** to normal clothing.

## Way #1: You can wear them in many more environments.

Ever feared riding up that hill and then being cold afterwards?  
**They keep you warm even when they're wet.**

Ever feared you'd smell too much after that?  
**They smell way less.**

And now the big one:

## Way #2: They are five T-Shirts in one

- They take up less space
- They reduce your choices of what to wear
- You don't need to wash that often, etc.
- They are cheaper: Assuming a normal T-Shirt costs 20€, a T-Shirt you can wear for 5 days straight but costs 80€ suddenly sounds like a good deal, doesn't it?

(What do you think about Merino T-Shirts? Is there anything I've missed?)
