We all know it already: It's important to stay hydrated throughout the day.

There may be something you don't know yet:

**You can drink too much water, too.**

For a long time, I did. I felt dizzy. Exhausted. Had Headaches. That should have been something for me to notice and do something against—right? The crazy thing is this: For me, the symptoms of drinking too much and too little water were so similar that I didn't notice.

People around did notice.

They mentioned it, and I wasn't convinced that I could be drinking too much water. I knew there had been times when I was dehydrated and felt very similar. But then, I learned that overhydration can feel very similar to dehydration: A good friend heard sent me an excerpt from a podcast featuring a story about overhydration and what it feels like.

I reduced my water intake, especially in the evening—and the symptoms almost instantly improved.

So, if you regularly feel dizzy, have headaches, need to go to the toilet often (especially during the night) and your urine is relatively light:

**Chances are you're not dehydrated, but overhydrated.**

Try to drink less for about three days, and you'll see whether you are.
