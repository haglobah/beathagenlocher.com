<Il href="things-that-stress-me-out">There's not that many things I find stressful</Il> (okay, that's a lie—but there's only very few things that stress me out _this much_)—but one of them was reading [[1984]].

I think about our world going down already all the time. And I can't help myself but have the feeling that this was Orwell's intention with about half of his writing (including everything _I've_ read from him so far): To let other people feel the same way.

Why do authors think they have to remind me about this?
