One of the more interesting parts of how LLMs interact with the world is the way in which they change how we can work with text.

Previously, every last piece of text had to be written by hand by a human with all of the quirks they had.

And now, with LLMs I can write a basic outline of a text and it creates a text out of it (while adhering to the general direction of the content).  
But the thing is that it does it in the very canonical style 'of the internet' (or has it been LLM-style, and only now the internet is full of LLM-texts?)

I think it's almost like we're creating something akin to a lingua franca but in writing _style_, not in writing _language_.
(Obviously English still is the lingua franca—this would but one level higher up the specificity/complexity hierachy _inside the english language_
