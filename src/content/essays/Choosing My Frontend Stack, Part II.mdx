What started out as me [[Choosing my Frontend Language]] evolved into me playing around with more and more parts of the frontend stack.

Some learnings:

- The longer I interact with it, the more I'm getting the feeling that the [[ClojureScript]] heavy reliance on the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure) is actually pretty bad.
- [bun](https://bun.sh) is _pretty darn fast_.
- It's highly confusing what exactly bun provides when comparing it to basically any other DX tool in the JS ecosystem.
  - It's a bundler like webpack/esbuild
  - It's a JS runtime like Node.js and Deno
  - It has a webserverâ€”but no _dev server_ with HMR. For that, you can/probably want to use [Vite](https://vite.dev/).
- But Vite is also basically everything you need on the JS side, except for being a JS runtime.
- There's two [[cljs]]-dialecty things called [[squint]] and [[cherry]] by [[borkdude]].

It's weird.
