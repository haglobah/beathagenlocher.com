What started out as me [[Choosing my Frontend Language]] evolved into me playing around with more and more parts of the frontend stack.

Some learnings:

- The longer I interact with it, the more I'm getting the feeling that [[ClojureScript]]s heavy reliance on the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure) is actually pretty bad.
- [bun](https://bun.sh) is _pretty darn fast_.  
It's highly confusing what exactly bun provides when comparing it to basically any other DX tool in the JS ecosystem:
  - It's a bundler like webpack/esbuild
  - It's a JS runtime like Node.js and Deno
  - It has a webserverâ€”but no _dev server_ with HMR. For that, you can/probably want to use [Vite](https://vite.dev/).
- But Vite is also basically everything you need on the JS side, except for being a JS runtime.
- There's two [[cljs]]-dialecty things called [squint](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint) and [cherry](https://github.com/squint-cljs/cherry) by [borkdude](https://github.com/borkdude).
- [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) are pretty neat.
  - no more shuffling state around
  - can define my reactive values super declaratively (computed stores)
- SolidJS (+nanostores) is actually pretty nice. I can shell out to React-as-it-should've-been whenever I like to, but can have my reactive values in a pretty declarative style in my store.

As of now, I'm relatively confident that bun/Vite/squint/SolidJS/nanostores is my new favourite frontend stack.
