Over the last few days, I've been evaluating [Rescript](https://rescript-lang.org/) and [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) as my go-to language for building interactive web app frontends with.

This is now the probably fifth time I've re-evaluated my frontend language, and I very much expect this isn't gonna be the last.

It started all out with me not liking [[JavaScript]] as much.
The reasonable thing to do probably would've been to just go for a JS Framework, but I .. didn't do that.

Instead, I tried to put my functional programming affinity to use and wrote my final [42](https://42heilbronn.de) project with [[Phoenix LiveView]]. That was.. pretty nice, especially because I like [[Elixir]] so much.  
It also _mostly_ worked so well because I could know for sure the internet would work reliably.

And that is something you cannot take for certain in basically every other project.
But I didn't know that then.  
Instead, I went and played around with my idea of [a simple project app](https://zelium.io), built it in [[Phoenix LiveView]], and found out the hard way that this is not its niche.  

You either:
- stay on the server and suffer from latency
- go to the client to not suffer from the latency, but then push data from Elixir to JS and back

Not a trade-off I'm willing to make.

Then, I started my job, and there, I'm currently mostly using [[ClojureScript]] for frontend stuff, which works.  
It has quite a few things I like a lot about it (Syntax, general Lispyness), but also a lot of things feel weird, or pretty much like an afterthought. ≺≻ [[Where ClojureScript Feels... Weird]]  
Also, it doesn't have a static type system, a thing I somehow especially value on the frontend.

And currently I'm in the process of accepting that since I want to build [[Local-first Software]] and don't want to write my own sync engine (yet, who knows), I have to rely on JS libraries.

So now I'm looking for a language/framework combination that lets me write simple declarative frontends with a strong and static type system with as close interoperability with JS/JS libraries as possible.

Which now made me jump back and forth between learning [[Gleam]]/[[Lustre]], [[ReScript]], and [[PureScript]]/[[Halogen]].

Well, what can I say?
At least I very much enjoy learning programming languages ^^
