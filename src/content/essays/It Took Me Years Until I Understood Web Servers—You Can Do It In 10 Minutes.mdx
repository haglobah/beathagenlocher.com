Web Servers are surprisingly simple.

A Web Server is a program that takes in a string and returns a string. The incoming and the outgoing string both adhere to rules: They follow a _protocol_. The protocol defines how the Web Server has to react to the incoming string. The protocol Web Servers follow is called [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP).

A Web Server is a program that reads _HTTP requests_ and returns _HTTP_ _responses_. There are a [number of requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), as well as [possible responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) (e.g. 200 Ok, 301 Moved permanently, 404 Not found). Those HTTP requests and responses get transmitted by another protocol, [TCP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP).

A Web Server is a program that typically runs on a machine somewhere on the [World Wide Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/World_Wide_Web). (And yes, this machine is called _Server_, too.) The World Wide Web is not the same as the [Internet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/How_does_the_Internet_work)—it's an application that runs on top of it. This machine has a lot of _ports_ (65535, to be exact), and if it has a Web Server on it, at least one of these ports is open: Port 80.

You know what? We can write a HTTP request by hand. Launch a terminal and type:

```shell
> curl --verbose telnet://google.com:80 (Enter)
* Host google.com:80 was resolved (... rest of telnet answer)
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: google.com (Hit Enter twice)

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
(... rest of HTTP response)
```
