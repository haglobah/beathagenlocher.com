There are a lot of books about Human Nature.

And I've read a lot of them.

But the best book on book on Human Nature I've read is **Humankind** by **Rutger Bregman**.

## For a few reasons:
- Reason #1: It profoundly changed how I view the world. I definitely didn't think that humans are inherently good before, but now I do.
- Reason #2: It tells great stories—I regularly find myself referencing and retelling them when discussing human nature with people:
  - What does really happen when high school kids strand on a barren island?
  - How much panic is there onboard when a plane is about to crash, and everyone knows it?
- Reason #3: It answers questions I didn't even consider before—for example:
  - Why do almost all domesticated animals look like adolescents when compared to their wild counterparts?
- Reason #4: It is just plain fun to read.

If you are at all interested in understanding Human Nature, I can't recommend this book enough. I routinely tell people if there's only one book they should read, this is it. It is that good.

(Did _you_ read it? If so, do you agree? Is there another book you would recommend? Besides **Sapiens** by **Yuval Noah Harari**, of course?)
