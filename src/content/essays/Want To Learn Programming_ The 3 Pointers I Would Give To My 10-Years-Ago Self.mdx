## #1 The goal

Soâ€”there's really two ways in which one 'is able to program'.

One is to **being able to use a programming language to achieve a certain result** (a)

The other one is to **understand the underlying concepts**, and being able to use them in every programming language that has them (b).

And _you_ clearly want (b).

## #2 How To Learn

Learning to program is like learning any other skill.

You want to understand a concept, then continue with very simple _worked examples_ of programs, and work your way towards coming up with _practice tests_ for yourself as you slowly transition form beginner to expert (per topic).

## #3 What To Learn

The concepts that exist in programming languages today mostly stem from two families. One of them view programming as the art of **manipulating a Turing Machine**, while the other one views progamming as the art of **manipulation expressions in the lambda calculus**.

Those are the two paths you want to pursue in parallel. Start with:

1. Learning C from the ground up: That teaches you how the machine works. Simple syscalls, pointers, memory allocation, and so on. There's a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/0131103628). For exercises, have a look [here](https://42-cursus.gitbook.io/guide).
2. Working through [_How to Design Programs_](https://htdp.org/): That teaches you how to write programs not only the machine, but also humans can understand.

That's for starters. Have fun!
