<Il href="does-your-repos-getting-started-section-take-more-than-10-minutes_-just-use-nix">Again</Il>: What _should_ setting up a new repo look like?

It should be something like this:

1. 'Create this kind of project'
2. Initialize the git repo
3. Create the first commit
4. Create the repo upstream `origin`
5. Then, push to `origin`, and set `origin` as upstream.

Okay. Let's say I want to create a new static website project. This is my workflow:

```shell
> md new-website
> nft my#pollen-template
> gi
> gam "Initial commit"
> ghi new-website
> gpo
```

Can't understand anything? Well, all of them are aliases/shell functions/abbreviations. This is what I typed:

```shell
> mkdir new-website && cd new-website
> nix flake init --template github:haglobah/flakes#pollen-template
> git init
> git add . && git commit --message "Initial commit"
> gh repo create new-website --private --source=. --remote=origin
> git push --set-upstream origin
```

And of course, it already brings its own [devshell](https://typeshare.co/haglobah/posts/does-your-repos-getting-started-section-have-more-than-10-minutes-just-use-nix).

How do you set up a new project? And do you have any suggestions for a better workflow? Let me hear in the comments!

Update (01/2026):

In the meantime, I've refined my aliases.

What I'm now thinking of when creating a repo is this:

1. 'Create this kind of project'
2. 'Make this version controlled'
3. 'Make the devshell work automatically'
4. 'Change the `flake.nix` to my liking'
5. 'Create this repo on Github'

Which makes it those commands

```shell
> np new-project devshell just
> gim
> ud
> # edit flake.nix
> gho
```

And those expand to:

```shell
> nix run github:haglobah/templater -Lv -- --to new-project devshell just
> git init && git add . && git commit --message "Initial commit"
> echo "use flake . -Lv" >> .envrc && direnv allow
> # edit flake.nix
> gh repo create new-project --private --source=. --remote=origin && git push --set-upstream origin main
```

Code for the abbreviations here: [fish.nix](https://github.com/haglobah/mynix/blob/8967900495a654575f56a372448e7852fd28c9bd/home/programs/fish.nix#L162)

<Callout type="error">
A word of warning:

**Do not** use the templater script! It's a the equivalent of a sharp knife without a handle _while not being properly maintained_.

It's _only_ for inspiration, **nothing else**.
