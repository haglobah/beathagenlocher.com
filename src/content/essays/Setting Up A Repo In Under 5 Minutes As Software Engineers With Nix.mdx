[Again](http://localhost:4321/does-your-repos-getting-started-section-take-more-than-10-minutes_-just-use-nix): What _should_ setting up a new repo look like?

It should be something like this:

1. 'Create this kind of project'
2. Initialize the git repo
3. Create the first commit
4. Create the repo upstream `origin`
5. Then, push to `origin`, and set `origin` as upstream.

Okay. Let's say I want to create a new static website project. This is my workflow: (prior to this post, hehe ^^)

```shell
> md new-website
> nft my#pollen-template
> gi
> gam "Initial commit"
> ghi new-website
> gpo
```

Can't understand anything? Well, all of them are aliases/shell functions/abbreviations. This is what I typed:

```shell
> mkdir new-website && cd new-website
> nix flake init --template github:haglobah/flakes#pollen-template
> git init
> git add . && git commit --message "Initial commit"
> gh repo create new-website --private --source=. --remote=origin
> git push --set-upstream origin
```

And of course, it already brings its own [devshell](https://typeshare.co/haglobah/posts/does-your-repos-getting-started-section-have-more-than-10-minutes-just-use-nix).

How do you set up a new project? And do you have any suggestions for a better workflow? Let me hear in the comments!
