For the longest time in my life, I just had all of the things I needed/wanted to do in my head.

This 'system' broke during my studies. (+ job + rootlinks)

- switched to calendar
- but not accessible from anywhere
- switched to obsidian
- switched to super-productivity
- switch to nirvana
- now, I find myself eyeing Todo.txt

I want to have the speed of _at least_ text editing in Emacs, with a mobile way to input things, with an easy way to prioritize by effort, urgency, and importance.

+ scheduling
+ chaning priority
