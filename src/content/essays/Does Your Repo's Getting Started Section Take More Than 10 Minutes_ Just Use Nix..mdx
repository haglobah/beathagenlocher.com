Let's first ask ourselves: What _should_ the Getting Started section of a project look like?

Abstractly, I think it should be something like this:

1. `git clone <repo-name> && cd <repo-name>`
2. "Install the necessary dependencies"
3. "Run the app as intended"

And well, we all know what it _can_ look likeâ€”I won't go into that here.

With a `devShell` from a [Nix Flake](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/flakes), we can get to this:
0. (You probably need to [install Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install) first: )
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```
1. `git clone <repo-name> && cd <repo-name>`
2. `nix develop`
3. "Run the app as intended"â€”if your `flake.nix`-Person did it right, `nix develop` should make clear how to do that.

And the best part? _One person_ can setup this flake, _once_â€”and the 'works on my machine'-days [are gone](https://mitchellh.com/writing/nix-with-dockerfiles).

That's all I've got for today. See you tomorrow! ðŸš¢ ðŸ‘‹
