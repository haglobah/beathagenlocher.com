Do you want to get better at:
1. Thinking clearly
2. Communicating your thoughts
3. Improving your reasoning?

I want to, and I think Writing in Public might be the way to go.
## Here's why:
1. _Writing_ forces me to think.
2. _Writing with an audience in mind_ forces me to make my thoughts concrete, explain context, and spot gaps.
3. _Writing in public_ invites discussions, enables people to point out flaws—giving me the opportunity to improve my reasoning.

I recently signed up for Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole's cohort-based course, Ship 30 for 30.

Over the next 30 days, I plan on writing about (functional) programming, living a simple(r) life, and whatever comes to mind.

Join me on this adventure—and let me know if you have any questions along the way!  
I'm excited to start sharing my thinking online.
