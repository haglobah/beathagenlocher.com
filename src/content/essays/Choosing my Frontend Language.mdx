Over the last few days, I've been evaluating [Rescript](https://rescript-lang.org/) and [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) as my go-to language for building interactive web app frontends with.

I originally started doing this with [[Phoenix LiveView]] but wasn't happy with the trade-offs.

Currently, I'm mostly using [[ClojureScript]] for frontend stuff at work. It has quite a few things that I like pretty much about it (Syntax, general Lispyness), but also a lot of things feel weird, or pretty much like an afterthought. ≺≻ [[Where ClojureScript Feels... Weird]]
