Over the last few days, I've been evaluating [Rescript](https://rescript-lang.org/) and [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) as my go-to language for building interactive web app frontends with.

This is now the probably fifth 

It started all out with me not liking [[JavaScript]] as much.
The reasonable thing to do probably would've been to just go for a JS Framework, but I didn't do that. Instead, I tried to put my functional programming affinity to use and wrote my final 42 project with [[Phoenix LiveView]]. That was.. pretty nice, especially because I like [[Elixir]] so much.  
However, it also mostly worked so well because I could know for sure the internet would work reliably.

That is something you can't know almost anywhere else.

I originally started doing this with [[Phoenix LiveView]] but wasn't happy with the trade-offs.

Currently, I'm mostly using [[ClojureScript]] for frontend stuff at work. It has quite a few things I like a lot about it (Syntax, general Lispyness), but also a lot of things feel weird, or pretty much like an afterthought. ≺≻ [[Where ClojureScript Feels... Weird]]  
Also, it doesn't have a static type system, a thing I somehow especially value on the frontend.



Well, at least for Rescript, there's a few things<Il href="what-i-wish-i-knew-when-learning-rescript">I wish I would've known</Il>.
