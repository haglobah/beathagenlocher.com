A pretty nice [[Programming Language]] created by [[Rich Hickey]].

Is at the same time **great** (partly because of its communities' focus on simplicity, elegance, and so on) and **really painful to use**â€”because they're just not able to consistently follow through with it.

Definitely one of the Programming Language communities that's prone to [[]]
